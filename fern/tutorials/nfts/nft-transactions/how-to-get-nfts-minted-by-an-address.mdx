Script to Get NFTs Minted by an Address

Open Recipe

Some of the reasons why you'd want to get NFTs minted by an address include:

* Displaying all NFTs minted by a user (created and sent to their address)
* Displaying all NFTs minted by a contract (shows you how many have been created)
* Understand which NFTs were "first owned" or originally minted by a given address

Surprisingly, this type of information is not easy to gather with the current [Ethereum API](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/apis/ethereum). That's why Alchemy builds a higher level \[Enhanced APIs ([https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/enhanced-apis](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/enhanced-apis)) to make building in Web3 much easier.

**In this tutorial, we'll be leveraging Alchemy's [Transfers API](/reference/transfers-api)(`alchemy_getAssetTransfers`) to fetch all NFTs minted by a particular account address.**

***

## What happens when NFTs are minted?

Under the hood, when an NFT is minted, it is transferred from the [null address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 to the user account or contract that minted it.

All token **creations** and **destructions** typically are **from** and **to** the null address respectively, so it's a good filter when looking for mint or burns events.

This on-chain minting emits a standard [transfer event](/reference/transfers-api#what-are-transfers) since the asset is being *transferred* from one account to another.

Since we can filter for transfer events using the \[Transfers API]ref:transfers-api), we can easily fetch NFT mints with the right parameter specification!

***

## How to get NFT Mint Events

In order to fetch NFTs minted by a given address we'll need to specify a few things in our [`alchemy_getAssetTransfers`](/reference/alchemy-getassettransfers) request:

* `fromAddress`: where the transaction originated from, in our case that’s always 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
* `toAddress`: the address we want to see mints from (NFTs go **to** the address that minted them)
* `fromBlock`: the starting time range we want to fetch NFT mints over (defaults to `latest`)
* `toBlock`: the ending time range we want to fetch NFT mints over (defaults to `latest`)
* `category`: the type of transfer events we care about, in our case we want to see NFTs which are ERC721 and ERC1155 events

Once we've specified these inputs we can send the request!

***

### Example: Getting NFT Mint Events

To demonstrate how to get the NFT mint events from an address we're going to walk through an example using the address [0x5c43B1eD97e52d009611D89b74fA829FE4ac56b1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5c43B1eD97e52d009611D89b74fA829FE4ac56b1) and get all NFT mint events from block 0 to latest.

## How to process the API response

Now that we have made a query and can see the response, let's learn how to handle the returned data.

### Raw API Response:

Without parsing the response, we have a console log that looks like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  {
    [
    {
      "blockNum": "0xc75329",
      "hash": "0xd89b54cb5aca6f501d43ee3363dcc892d31d1c185c9059c22d686ca0a1b93314",
      "from": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "to": "0x5c43b1ed97e52d009611d89b74fa829fe4ac56b1",
      "value": null,
      "erc721TokenId": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012",
      "erc1155Metadata": null,
      "tokenId": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012",
      "asset": "BURN",
      "category": "erc721",
      "rawContract": {
        "value": null,
        "address": "0x18a808dd312736fc75eb967fc61990af726f04e4",
        "decimal": null
      }
    },
    ...
    {
      "blockNum": "0xd8315a",
      "hash": "0x270aa9026d69b0924341e0ce60b24182f1f2af8a4bcc752b8e65595bdeca565f",
      "from": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "to": "0x5c43b1ed97e52d009611d89b74fa829fe4ac56b1",
      "value": null,
      "erc721TokenId": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000fb",
      "erc1155Metadata": null,
      "tokenId": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000fb",
      "asset": null,
      "category": "erc721",
      "rawContract": {
        "value": null,
        "address": "0x947600ad1ad2fadf88faf7d30193d363208fc76d",
        "decimal": null
      }
    }
  ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Understanding API Response:

Below are the components of the each transfer in our response.

* `blockNum`: the block number where an NFT mint event occurred, in `hex`

* `hash`: the transaction hash of NFT minting transaction

* `from`: where the transaction originated from, in our case that’s always 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

* `to`: the address we want to see mints from (NFTs go to \*\*\*\* the address that minted them), should be the same address specified in our request

* `value`: the amount of ETH transferred, should always be `null` in our case since we're only looking at NFT mints, not sales

* `erc721TokenId`: the ERC721 token ID. `null` if not an ERC721 token transfer.

* `erc1155Metadata`: a list of objects containing the ERC1155 `tokenId` and `value`. `null` if not an ERC1155 transfer

* `tokenId`: the token ID for ERC721 tokens or other NFT token standards

* `asset`: `ETH` or the token's symbol. `null` if not defined in the contract and not available from other sources.

* `rawContract`

  * `value`: `null` since we're looking at ERC721 & ERC1155 transfer
  * `address`: NFT contract address
  * `decimal`: `null`

### Printing out the token `type`, `tokenId` and contract `address`

There's lots of information we can pull from this response. One example you may be interested in displaying are: NFT contract standard (`ERC721` or `ERC1155`), `contractAddress`, and `tokenId`

With our queried response saved as a JSON object, we can index through the transfers. In particular, we first access the transfers list and then iterate accross a few key parameters: `erc1155Metadata` , `tokenId`, and `rawContract`.

The steps we want to take are:

1. Loop through all transfers in the result

2. Check whether the returned transfer is ERC1155 or not

   1. If so, loop through tokens within ERC1155
      1. print `tokenId` and `address` for each
   2. If not, assume transfer is ERC721
      1. print `tokenID` of contract and address

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript nft-mints.js
  for (const events of res.data.result.transfers) {
        if (events.erc1155Metadata == null) {
          console.log("ERC-721 Token Minted: ID- ", events.tokenId, " Contract- ", events.rawContract.address);
        }
        else{
          for (const erc1155 of events.erc1155Metadata) {
          console.log("ERC-1155 Token Minted: ID- ", erc1155.tokenId, " Contract- ", events.rawContract.address);
          }
        }
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you followed along, your response should look like the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
