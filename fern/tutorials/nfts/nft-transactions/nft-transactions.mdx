# Introduction

Getting information about NFT transactions is important because it allows for the tracking and verification of ownership and transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs often represent unique and valuable assets, such as digital art, collectibles, and other one-of-a-kind items. By getting information about NFT transactions, it is possible to establish the provenance and ownership history of an NFT, which can be used to determine its value and authenticity. This is particularly important for NFTs that are being bought and sold in secondary markets, as it allows buyers and sellers to have confidence in the legitimacy of the transaction. Additionally, getting information about NFT transactions can be useful for tracking the movement and distribution of NFTs within a particular ecosystem or application.
