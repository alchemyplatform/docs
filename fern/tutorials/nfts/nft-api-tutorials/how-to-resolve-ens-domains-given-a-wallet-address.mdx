<Info>
  This tutorial uses the **[getNFTs](/reference/getnfts)** endpoint.
</Info>

The Alchemy SDK makes it possible to parse ENS names from an address and perform the reverse to get the address of an ENS name. This latter case is useful when there's a need to get more data from an (Address), such as contracts which have been deployed by the Wallet Address.

The (ENS)‚Äôs job is to map human-readable names like ‚Äòalice.eth‚Äô to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata.

In this guide, we walk you through How to get an ENS name from an EOA.

## What tools do you need to find an ENS name?

1. Create a [free Alchemy account](https://alchemy.com/?a=eb01f405c5) to access the [NFT API Endpoints](/reference/nft-api-endpoints)
2. Select a wallet address to request ENS domains from (i.e. ‚Äú0x‚Ä¶XXX‚Äù)
3. [Alchemy SDK](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart) (recommended)

***

## How do you find a wallet‚Äôs owned ENS names?

Because all ENS domains are ERC721 tokens (NFTs), [NFT API](/reference/nft-api-endpoints) is a powerful tool for querying blockchains for data about wallets that own ENS domains. Let‚Äôs set up our basic environment in your code editor and terminal by following instructions as mentioned in the [NFT API Quickstart Guide](/reference/nft-api-quickstart). We‚Äôll be using npm in this example.

### 1. Create a new repository with Alchemy's NFT API

Open up a terminal, and from the command line, create a new repository to hold your quickstart scripts. We'll also initialize the repo as an npm project.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  mkdir alchemy-nft-api
  cd alchemy-nft-api
  npm init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Install the Alchemy SDK

Navigate into your project directory and run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. \[optional] Load ES6 modules

If you run into module errors, you may need to add `'type':'module'` to your `package.json` because we'll be utilizing import syntax to load ES6 modules in our script.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json package.json
  {
  ...
  "type": "module"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Write script using [getNFTs](/reference/getnfts) to get ENS domains

To get the ENS domains for a given address, we'll make a request to [getNFTs with contract filtering](/reference/getnfts) The contract that we'll specify in the request is the address for all ENS contracts: `0x57f1887a8BF19b14fC0dF6Fd9B2acc9Af147eA85`

In this example we'll get the owned ENS domains for address 0x458d1E307CcA61C0Bea82f7663F66831175EcDe8

Create a file in your repository called `resolve-ens.js` and paste in the following

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript resolve-ens.js
  // Setup: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const config = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->",
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,
  };
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const walletAddress = "0x458d1E307CcA61C0Bea82f7663F66831175EcDe8"; // replace with wallet address
  const ensContractAddress = "0x57f1887a8BF19b14fC0dF6Fd9B2acc9Af147eA85";
  const nfts = await alchemy.nft.getNftsForOwner(walletAddress, {
    contractAddresses: [ensContractAddress],
  });

  console.log(nfts);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 5. Print ENS objects

From the command line, run `node resolve-ens.js` :

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  {
    ownedNfts: [
      {
        contract: [Object],
        id: [Object],
        balance: '1',
        title: 'elanhalpern.eth',
        description: 'elanhalpern.eth, an ENS name.',
        tokenUri: [Object],
        media: [Array],
        metadata: [Object],
        timeLastUpdated: '2022-03-07T07:50:03.443Z'
      },
      {
        contract: [Object],
        id: [Object],
        balance: '1',
        title: 'cryptocreamery.eth',
        description: 'cryptocreamery.eth, an ENS name.',
        tokenUri: [Object],
        media: [Array],
        metadata: [Object],
        timeLastUpdated: '2022-03-05T06:21:12.583Z'
      }
    ],
    totalCount: 2,
    blockHash: '0xc983065bae1b5a52a87b3bdce7f3669cb56f9f843c348ffe44d23742bf5fff76'
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The title field in our `ownedNFT` objects is the name of the ENS domain. In this case, the address owns two ENS domains:

* `elanhalpern.eth`
* `cryptocreamery.eth`

And that's it! You can now easily get any ENS domains from a given wallet address üéâ

Sometimes, after you have successfully resolved the ENS domain name, you may want to parse the Wallet address of the ENS. This can be achieved using the Alchemy core SDK `resolveName` method.
