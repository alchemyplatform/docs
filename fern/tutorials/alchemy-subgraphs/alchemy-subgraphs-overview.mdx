Alchemy Subgraphs (formerly Satsuma) is a blockchain indexing platform with drop-in support for hosted subgraphs.

## Understanding Subgraphs

Alchemy Subgraphs allow developers to create specialized APIs, aka **subgraphs**, that define how to ingest, process, and store information from the blockchain, making it easier for apps to query blockchain data

## Pain Points Addressed by Alchemy Subgraphs

Alchemy Subgraphs offer a solution designed to mitigate the following pain points and streamline the process for developers:

### **1. In-House Indexing System Limitations**

The main alternative to subgraphs is developing an in-house indexing system, which is resource-intensive, and has considerable drawbacks:

* **Engineering Time & Cost**: Engineering resources from product development are diverted in order to construct and maintain a custom indexing system.
* **Complexity & Expertise**: Building an indexing system requires specialized knowledge about blockchain intricacies, such as reorgs and data decoding. Companies often face a steep learning curve or need to hire additional, specialized staff.

### **2. Limitations with *Existing* Subgraph Services**

Using subgraphs with other current hosted services, also comes with its challenges:

* **Performance Issues**: Slow initial sync times, reindexes, and query response can bottleneck development.
* **Reliability Concerns**: Downtime and inconsistent API performance, often due to operational inefficiencies, user abuse, or maintenance, can disrupt services.
* **Lack of Visibility**: Insufficient insights into indexing and query metrics lead to a lack of trust and additional time spent debugging.
* **Data Lag**: Delays in data updates can impede real-time functionality.
* **Customer Support**: Limited or no direct support hampers problem resolution.

Current decentralized services introduce further complications:

* **Operational Overhead**: Using this service entails complex processes such as acquiring and staking tokens, and signaling your subgraph to indexers.
* **Exposure and Privacy**: The necessity to make your subgraph publicly accessible.
* **Indexer Reliance**: No guarantee that indexers will prioritize or even process your subgraph.
* **Technical Support**: Lack of a direct line for technical support to indexers can prolong issue resolution.

### **3. Self-Hosting Difficulties**

Self-hosting subgraphs brings its own set of issues:

* **Maintenance Burden**: Operators need to invest significant time and effort into system upkeep.
* **Performance Dependency**: Indexing speed is contingent on running personal RPC nodes.
* **Infrastructure Costs**: There are high costs associated with running the necessary graph node, database, and RPC nodes.
