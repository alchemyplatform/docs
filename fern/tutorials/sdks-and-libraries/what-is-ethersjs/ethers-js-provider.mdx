## What is a Provider in Ethers.js?

A Provider is an abstraction to the Ethereum Network that allows developers to connect to a standard Ethereum node permitting read-only access to the blockchain.

Ethers.js also offers providers for different services each connecting to their respected network. This includes the AlchemyProvider, EtherscanProvider, InfuraProvider, CloudflareProvider, PoketProvider and AnkrProvider - all providing a web API for connecting to the blockchain.

### Ethers.js Provider Use Cases

The following consists of potential use cases with Provider within [Ethers.js](/docs/what-is-ethers-js):

#### Account Methods

* provider.**getBalances** - retrieve the balances from specific addresses
* provider.**getTransactionCount** - retrieve the total number of transactions an address has sent

#### Network Status Methods

* provider.**getGasPrice** - retrieve the gas price for a transaction that is displayed to a user
* provider.**getNetwork** - retrieve the network to confirm an user can complete a transaction

#### Transactions Methods

* provider.**call** - read from the blockchain and execute smart contracts, but cannot publish to the blockchain.
* provider.**getTransaction** - retrieve the transaction hash to confirm the completion of an execution by the user.

There are many more use cases that can be explored by visiting the Provider docs, [here](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/single-page/#/v5/api/providers/provider/).

### How to Use a Provider with Ethers.js

The following code snippets require prior installation of ethers and alchemy-SDK.

#### 1. Import ethers using Node.js.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const { ethers } = require("ethers");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 2. Define network configurations via Mainnet.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const network = "mainnet";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 3. Retrieve the API key from Alchemy. For this example, “demo” is used as the API key.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  async function blockNum() {
      const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider(network, 'demo')
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 4. Define network configurations via Testnet.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  async function blockNum() {
  // ...
      const output = await provider.getBlockNumber();
      console.log(output);
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### How to Use a Provider with the Alchemy SDK

The following code snippets require prior installation of the alchemy-SDK.

#### 1. Import alchemy-sdk

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  import { Alchemy } from 'alchemy-sdk';
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 2. Optional Config object, but defaults to demo api-key and eth-mainnet.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const settings = {
      apiKey: 'demo', // Replace with your Alchemy API Key.
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network.
  };

  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 3. Utilize core to refer to all commonly-used Ethers.js Provider methods and Alchemy Enhanced API methods.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  // Access standard Ethers.js JSON-RPC node request
  alchemy.core.getBlockNumber().then(console.log);

  // Access Alchemy Enhanced API requests
  alchemy.core.getTokenBalances("0x3f5CE5FBFe3E9af3971dD833D26bA9b5C936f0bE").then(console.log);
  ```
</CodeGroup>
