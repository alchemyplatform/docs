## What is a Signer in ethers.js?

A Signer is an abstraction to the Ethereum Account that has access to a private key, which grants access to messages and transactions to be securely signed off-chain while maintaining an interaction with the blockchain.

A Signer allows you to verify that you own a particular account, so that you can send transactions to the blockchain from that account.

### Ethers.js Signer Use Cases

The following are four potential use cases of a Signer within [Ethers.js](/docs/what-is-ethers-js):

* **Balances** - use signer.**getBalance** to retrieve the balance of a user’s wallet
* **ENS Domains** - use signer.**resolveName** to retrieve the [ENS domain](https://docs.ens.domains/) connected to the wallet address.
* **Signing** - use signer.**signTransaction** to sign a transaction to confirm ownership by a specific wallet address.
* **Wallet** - use ethers.**Wallet** to create a new wallet by passing in a private key identifying the owner of the wallet.

There are many more use cases that can be explored by visiting the Signer docs, [here](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/single-page/#/v5/api/signer/).

## How to Use a Signer with the Alchemy SDK

This example will teach you how to send a transaction using the Alchemy SDK. Please Note: The following code snippets require prior [installation of alchemy-SDK](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart).

#### 1. Import Alchemy, Network, Wallet and Utils via alchemy-sdk. Learn more about dotev, [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const { Alchemy, Network, Wallet, Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");
  const dotenv = require("dotenv");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 2. Optional Config object, but defaults to demo api-key and eth-mainnet.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const { API_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;
  const settings = {
      apiKey: API_KEY,
      network: Network.ETH_GOERLI, // Replace with your network.
  };

  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 3. Define wallet - an implementation of Signer that can sign transactions and messages using a private key.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  let wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 4. Define the transaction and specify details required of the transaction.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const transaction = {
      to: "0xa238b6008Bc2FBd9E386A5d4784511980cE504Cd",
      value: Utils.parseEther("0.001"),
      gasLimit: "21000",
      maxPriorityFeePerGas: Utils.parseUnits("5", "gwei"),
      maxFeePerGas: Utils.parseUnits("20", "gwei"),
      nonce: await alchemy.core.getTransactionCount(wallet.getAddress()),
      type: 2,
      chainId: 5, // Corresponds to ETH_GOERLI
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 5. Define the raw transaction using wallet and transact using Alchemy’s API methods.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const rawTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);
  await alchemy.transact.sendTransaction(rawTransaction);
  ```
</CodeGroup>
