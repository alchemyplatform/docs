## What is a Contract in Ethers.js?

A Contract is an abstraction to a specific contract on the blockchain. It can be used as a JavaScript/TypeScript object that allows developers to read, write and deploy contracts to and from the blockchain.

### Ethers.js Contract Use Cases

The following consists of potential use cases with Contract within [Ethers.js](/docs/what-is-ethers-js):

* **Creating Instances** - use contract.**attach** to retrieve a new instance of a contract associated with an address. This allows users to interact with multiple identical contracts that inherit from each other and repeat actions.
* **Properties** - use contract.**address** to retrieve the contract or ensName that created the contract to confirm with the user the validity or security of a specific contract.
* **Events** - use contract.**queryFilter** to retrieve events that match a specific event a user wants to conduct.

There are many more use cases that can be explored by visiting the Contract docs, [here](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/single-page/#/v5/api/contract/).

## How to Use a Contract with the Alchemy SDK

This example will teach you how to deploy a contract using the Alchemy SDK. Please Note: The following code snippets require prior [installation of the alchemy-SDK](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart).

#### 1. Import Alchemy, Network, Wallet and ContractFactory via alchemy-sdk

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const { Network, Alchemy, Wallet, ContractFactory } = require("alchemy-sdk");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 2. Optional Config object, but defaults to demo api-key and eth-mainnet.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const settings = {
      apiKey: "demo", // Replace with your Alchemy API Key.
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network.
  };

  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 3. Insert the contract abi and bytecode of the smart contract.

* ```md
  **[Application Binary Interface (ABI)](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-an-abi-of-a-smart-contract-examples-and-usage)**: The ability to community and interact with external applications and other smart contracts.
  ```
* ```md
  **[Bytecode](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-interpret-binaries-in-solidity)**: The raw data published via a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain. 
  ```

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const abi = [{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"name","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]; // Replace with your Smart Contract’s ABI.

  const bytecode = "...";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 4. Locate the private key of your wallet.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  let privateKey = "...";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 5. Setup the wallet used to deploy the contract.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  let wallet = new Wallet(privateKey, alchemy);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 6. Create an instance of a Contract Factory.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  async function deployContract() {

     // Create an instance of a Contract Factory
     let factory = new ContractFactory(abi, bytecode, wallet);

  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 7. Create a constructor that will hold “Hello World" as the parameter.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  async function deployContract() {
    // ...
     let contract = await factory.deploy("Hello World");
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### 8. Display the contract address and the transaction hash of the contract deployed.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  async function deployContract() {
     // ...
     console.log(contract.address);
     console.log(contract.deployTransaction.hash);

     await contract.deployed()
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>
