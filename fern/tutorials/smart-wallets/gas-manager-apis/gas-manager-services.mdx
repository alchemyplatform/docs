## What is a Gas Manager?

A Gas Manager or Paymaster is an onchain contract that allows an entity to sponsor the gas fees for another entity. It can be used by dapps or companies to abstract away the concept of gas from their users. This significantly enhances the UX of dapps and can help onboard the next wave of Web3 users.

### Benefits of Using a Gas Manager

Gas managers are valuable for web3 companies that want to enhance user experiences and attract more users.

**1. Attracting New Users**

Gas fees can complicate participating in web3 for new users. However, Gas Managers make web3 more accessible because dapps can reduce the user's worry about owning a chain's native currency by sponsoring gas fees.

**2. Enhanced Security**

Gas Managers authenticate transactions and ensure payments are carried out only when specific conditions are fulfilled. This significantly reduces the chances of fraud and errors.

**3. Customizable Rules**

Gas Manager's allow developers to set specific rules for sponsoring your user's gas fees. This means devs can determine when and how the gas fees will be sponsored.
