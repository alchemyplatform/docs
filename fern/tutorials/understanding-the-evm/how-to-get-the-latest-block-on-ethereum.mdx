<Info>
  This tutorial uses the **[getBlockNumber](/reference/sdk-getblocknumber)** endpoint.
</Info>

*This guide assumes you've gone through the [getting started](/docs/alchemy-quickstart-guide) steps and have an [Alchemy account!](https://alchemy.com/?r=affiliate:b92f4e01-cafb-4038-83f4-372a42df5171)*

## 1. From your command line, create a new project directory and `cd` into it:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  mkdir web3-example
  cd web3-example
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Install the Alchemy SDK if you have not already

You can use any [web3 library ](/docs/alchemy-quickstart-guide)of your choosing, however there are tons of benefits to using the [Alchemy SDK](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart).

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```text yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Create a file named `index.js` and add the following contents:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  // Setup: npm install @alch/alchemy-sdk
  const { Network, Alchemy } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Optional Config object, but defaults to demo api-key and eth-mainnet.
  const settings = {
    apiKey: "demo", // Replace with your Alchemy API Key.
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network.
  };

  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

  async function main() {
    const latestBlock = await alchemy.core.getBlockNumber();
    console.log("The latest block number is", latestBlock);
  }

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  You should ultimately replace `demo` with your Alchemy HTTP API key.
</Warning>

## 4. Run it using node

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

5. You should now see the latest block number output in your console!

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  The latest block number is 11043912
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Woo! Congrats! You just wrote your first web3 script using Alchemy ðŸŽ‰
