## ðŸ˜« Problem: Transactions are Unpredictable

* Transactions can get dropped for seemingly no reason, costing you money and time
* Transactions can be extremely slow from the time you send them to the time they get mined
* Public transactions can fall victim to frontrunning and arbitrage
* Users have to manually refresh their apps to know the status of their transactions

## ðŸ˜ƒ Solution: Alchemy Transact

Alchemy Transact replaces opaque complexity with actionable clarity in the transaction life-cycle.

### How it works

Transactions occur in 4 primary steps: **1. Create** You decide to send a transaction at a specific gas price **2. Simulate** You preview how your transaction will behave once itâ€™s sent **3. Send** You send your transaction to get executed on chain **4. Monitor** You follow along to ensure your transaction is successful

**At each step, Alchemy Transact can help optimize the transaction to increase its chances of going through quickly, reliably, safely and affordably:**

## Features

## 1. Private Transactions

The [Private Transactions](/reference/eth-sendprivatetransaction) endpoints are a way to send and cancel transactions without exposing them to the public mempool, preventing unwanted arbitrage and front running.

## 2. Notify

[Alchemy Notify](/docs/alchemy-notify) offers a key benefit within the transaction lifecycle, giving you real-time alerts when transactions are mined or dropped from the mempool. This allows you to notify your users when transactions are final instead, so they donâ€™t have to refresh the screen to see if the transaction was confirmed.

# Features that are coming soon:

Alchemy Transact is just getting started and thereâ€™s a lot on the roadmap. [Sign up to get on the waitlist](https://alchemyapi.typeform.com/to/EhW0nBC1) for whatâ€™s next.

## 3. Gas Optimized Transactions

Gas Optimized functionality will provide better gas price estimates than a single node. Minimize transaction cost without compromising on transaction success.

## 4. Simulated Transactions

Know exactly what on-chain actions will take place to protect users from scam contracts.

## 5. Gas Oracle

Preview transaction cost with gas price estimates based off the global mempool.
