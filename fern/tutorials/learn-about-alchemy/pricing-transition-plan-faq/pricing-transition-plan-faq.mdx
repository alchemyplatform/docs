### Pricing Transition Plan FAQ

We are switching to usage-based pricing on February 1st, 2025, and offering a 6-month transition plan for builders who might face higher costs. The plan maintains current monthly fees and compute unit allocations through July 31st, 2025, after which all accounts switch to the new pricing model.

## About Your Special Transition Plan

**What's happening to my current plan?**

Starting February 1st, 2025, we're moving to usage-based pricing. While this change will lower costs for almost all developers, we noticed your project might experience higher costs. And we don‚Äôt want that. So we've carefully designed a special 6-month transition plan just for you.

* Credits are automatically added on the 1st of each month, if your card is successfully charged for your monthly fee.
