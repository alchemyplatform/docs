## Benefits of adding the Alchemy badge

1. **💵 50M CUs of free Alchemy credits monthly** - providing ongoing support for your project.

2. **⚡️ 50% more throughput** - 150 more [computing units per seconds](/reference/compute-units) (”CUPS”) to build faster

3. **📣 Legitimacy signal** - the purpose of this badge is that Alchemy certifies your project’s infrastructure and instills trust. At Alchemy’s discretion, we may include projects in marketing avenues like our newsletter or Twitter – this is on an ad-hoc basis

## Step 1 – Find the Unique Referral Token

You need to get the unique referral token of your team. Therefore, go to your team dashboard ([log into your Alchemy account](https://www.alchemy.com/)) and **click on the “Get $100+” button.**

Highlight just the unique referral token part (everything after “?r=”). You’ll enter that in the code snippet below in Step 3.

## Step 2 – Add the Badge Code to Your Website's Code

In the code below, replace the words ‘UNIQUE ALCHEMY TEAM REFERRAL TOKEN HERE’ with your unique referral token from Step 2. Please add the badge to your project's official website.

If your website is in React, copy the Alchemy JS into your code and then attach the "logBadgeClick()" function to the window and call it inside of your React code.
