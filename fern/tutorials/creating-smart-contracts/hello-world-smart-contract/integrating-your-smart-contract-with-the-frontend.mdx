You'll need to have finished part 1: [creating and deploying a smart contract](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract), part 2: [interacting with your smart contract](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/interacting-with-a-smart-contract), and part 3: [submitting your smart contract to Etherscan](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/submitting-your-smart-contract-to-etherscan) before starting part 4 below.

## Part 4: Marrying Web2 & Web3: connecting your smart contract to a frontend project

üéâWoooo! You finally made it to the last part of this tutorial series: creating a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) by connecting your Hello World smart contract to a frontend project and interacting with it.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:

* Connect a Metamask wallet to your dApp project
* Read data from your smart contract using the [Alchemy Web3](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/documentation/alchemy-web3) API
* Sign Ethereum transactions using Metamask

For this dApp, we'll be using [React](https://reactjs.org/) as our frontend framework; however, it's important to note that we won't be spending much time breaking down its fundamentals, as we'll mostly be focusing on bringing Web3 functionality to our project.

<Info>
  As a prerequisite, you should have a beginner-level understanding of React‚Äîknow-how components, props, `useStsate/useEffect`, and basic function calling works. If you've never heard of any of those terms before, we recommend that you check out this [Intro to React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). For more visual learners, we highly recommend this awesome Net Ninja [Full Modern React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) video series.
</Info>

What are we here for? Let's get started! üòé

## Step 1: Clone the starter files

First, go to the [hello-world-part-four github repository](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/hello-world-part-four-tutorial) to get the starter files for this project. Clone this repository into your local environment.

<Info>
  Don't know how to clone a repository? Check out [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) from GitHub.
</Info>

When you open this cloned **hello-world-part-four** repository, you'll notice that it contains two folders: **starter-files** and **completed**.

* **starter-files** contains the starter files (essentially the React UI) for this project. In this tutorial, **we will be working in this directory**, as you learn how to bring this UI to life by connecting it to your Ethereum wallet and the Hello World smart contract that you published on Etherscan in [Part 3](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/submitting-your-smart-contract-to-etherscan).
* **completed** contains the entire completed tutorial and is there for you as a **reference if you get stuck**.

Next, open your copy of **starter-files** to your favorite code editor (at Alchemy, we are big fans of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)), and then navigate into your *src* folder:

![2880](895422b-src_Folder.png "src Folder.png")

The src Folder in the codebase.

All of the code we'll write will live under the src folder. We'll be editing the *HelloWorld.js* component and the *util/interact.js* javascript files to give our project Web3 functionality.

## Step 2: Check out the starter files

Before we start coding, it's super important that we figure out what's already provided for us in the starter files.

### Get your react project running

Let's start by running the React project in our browser. The beauty of React is that once we have our project running in our browser, any changes we save will be updated live in our browser. To get the project running, navigate to the root directory of the **starter-files** folder

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  cd starter-files
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Then copy the below `package.json` file and replace it with the one in the `starter-files` directory. This is because most dependencies in the former `package.json` file has been deprecated. The one below is the appropriate update to all dependencies.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json package.json
  {
    "name": "hello-world-part-four",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "private": true,
    "dependencies": {
      "@alch/alchemy-web3": "^1.4.7",
      "@testing-library/jest-dom": "6.1.0",
      "@testing-library/react": "14.0.0",
      "@testing-library/user-event": "14.4.3",
      "alchemy-sdk": "^2.10.0",
      "browserify-zlib": "^0.2.0",
      "crypto-browserify": "^3.12.0",
      "dotenv": "16.3.1",
      "http-browserify": "^1.7.0",
      "https-browserify": "^1.0.0",
      "node-polyfill-webpack-plugin": "^2.0.1",
      "os-browserify": "^0.3.0",
      "path": "^0.12.7",
      "path-browserify": "^1.0.1",
      "react": "18.2.0",
      "react-dom": "18.2.0",
      "react-scripts": "^5.0.1",
      "stream": "^0.0.2",
      "stream-browserify": "^3.0.0",
      "stream-http": "^3.2.0",
      "web-vitals": "3.4.0"
    },
    "scripts": {
      "start": "react-scripts start",
      "build": "react-scripts build",
      "test": "react-scripts test",
      "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    },
    "eslintConfig": {
      "extends": [
        "react-app",
        "react-app/jest"
      ]
    },
    "browserslist": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Then run **npm install** in your terminal to install the dependencies of the project:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  npm install
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The next step is to include some of the newly installed dependencies in your `webpack.config.js` file. Locate the file in your *node\_modules* `react-scripts` directory, i.e., `/Users/...../hello-world-part-four-tutorial/starter-files/node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js`.

Add the following to the `resolve` object in the file as shown below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text webpack.config.js
    fallback: {
      http: require.resolve('stream-http'),
      https: require.resolve('https-browserify'),
      zlib: require.resolve('browserify-zlib'),
    },
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The image below describes this as well:

![](563a3f8-Screenshot_2023-09-07_at_3.40.11_PM.png)

Once the modules have finished installing and you've updated the `webpack.config.js` file, run **npm start** in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  npm start
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Doing so should open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, where you'll see the frontend for our project. It should consist of one field (a place to update the message stored in your smart contract), a "Connect Wallet" button, and an "Update" button.

![2864](e03bff0-Frontend.png "Frontend.png")

What the UI should look like.

If you try clicking the "Connect Wallet" or "Update" buttons, you'll notice that they don't work because we still need to program their functionality!

### The `HelloWorld.js` component

<Warning>
  Make sure you're in the **starter-files** folder and not the completed folder!
</Warning>

Let's return to the *src* folder in our editor and open the **HelloWorld.js** file. We must understand everything in this file, as it is the primary React component we will be working on.

At the top of this file, you'll notice we have several import statements that are necessary to get our project running, including the React library, useEffect, and useState hooks, and some items from the *./util/interact.js* (we'll describe them in more details soon!), and the Alchemy logo. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  import React from "react";
  import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
  import {
    helloWorldContract,
    connectWallet,
    updateMessage,
    loadCurrentMessage,
    getCurrentWalletConnected,
  } from "./util/interact.js";

  import alchemylogo from "./alchemylogo.svg";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next, we have the state variables that we will update after specific events.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  //State variables
  const [walletAddress, setWallet] = useState("");
  const [status, setStatus] = useState("");
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("No connection to the network.");
  const [newMessage, setNewMessage] = useState("");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Never heard of React state variables or state hooks? Check out [these](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) docs.
</Info>

Here's what each of the variables represents:

* **walletAddress** - a string that stores the user's wallet address
* **status** - a string that stores a helpful message that guides the user on how to interact with the dApp
* **message** - a string that stores the current message in the smart contract
* **newMessage** - a string that stores the new message that will be written to the smart contract

After the state variables, you'll see five un-implemented functions: *useEffect*, *addSmartContractListener*, *addWalletListener*, *connectWalletPressed*, and *onUpdatePressed*. We'll explain what they do below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  //called only once
    useEffect(() => { //TODO: implement

    }, []);

    function addSmartContractListener() { //TODO: implement

    }

    function addWalletListener() { //TODO: implement

    }

    const connectWalletPressed = async () => { //TODO: implement

    };

    const onUpdatePressed = async () => { //TODO: implement

    };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* **[useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)**- This is a React hook that is called after your component is rendered. Because it has an empty array\[] prop passed into it (see line 4), it will only be called on the component's first render. Here, we'll load the current message stored in our smart contract, call our smart contract and wallet listeners, and update our UI to reflect whether a wallet is already connected.
* **addSmartContractListener**- This function sets up a listener that will watch for our HelloWorld contract's UpdatedMessages event and update our UI when the message is changed in our smart contract.
* **addWalletListener**- This function sets up a listener that detects changes in the user's Metamask wallet state, such as when the user disconnects their wallet or switches addresses.
* **connectWalletPressed**- This function will be called to connect the user's Metamask wallet to our dApp.
* **onUpdatePressed** - This function will be called when the user wants to update the message stored in the smart contract.

Near the end of this file, we have the UI of our component.

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx HelloWorld.jsx
  // the UI of our component
  const HelloWorld = () => {
    return (
      <div id="container">
        <img id="logo" src={alchemylogo}></img>
        <button id="walletButton" onClick={connectWalletPressed}>
          {walletAddress.length > 0 ? (
            "Connected: " +
            String(walletAddress).substring(0, 6) +
            "..." +
            String(walletAddress).substring(38)
          ) : (
            <span>Connect Wallet</span>
          )}
        </button>

        <h2 style={{ paddingTop: "50px" }}>Current Message:</h2>
        <p>{message}</p>

        <h2 style={{ paddingTop: "18px" }}>New Message:</h2>

        <div>
          <input
            type="text"
            placeholder="Update the message in your smart contract."
            onChange={(e) => setNewMessage(e.target.value)}
            value={newMessage}
          />
          <p id="status">{status}</p>

          <button id="publishButton" onClick={onUpdatePressed}>
            Update
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you scan this code carefully, you'll notice where we use our various state variables in our UI:

* On lines 6-12, if the user's wallet is connected **(i.e., walletAddress.length > 0)**, we display a truncated version of the user *walletAddress* in the button with ID **"walletButton;"** otherwise, it simply says **"Connect Wallet."**
* On line 17, we display the current message stored in the smart contract, which is captured in the *message* string.
* On lines 23-26, we use a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) to update our *newMessage* state variable when the input in the text field changes.

In addition to our state variables, you'll also see that the **connectWalletPressed** and **onUpdatePressed** functions are called when the buttons with IDs **publishButton** and **walletButton** are clicked, respectively.

Finally, let's address where is this **HelloWorld.js** component added.

If you go to the **App.js** file, which is the main component in React that acts as a container for all other components, you'll see that our **HelloWorld.js** component is injected on line 7.

Lastly, let's check out one more file provided for you, the **interact.js** file.

### The `interact.js` file

Because we want to prescribe the [M-V-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (Model - View - Controller) paradigm, we'll want a separate file that contains all our functions to manage the logic, data, and rules of our dApp, and then be able to export those functions to our frontend (our **HelloWorld.js** component).

üëÜüèΩThis is the exact purpose of our **interact.js** file!

Navigate to the *util* folder in your *src* directory, and you'll notice we've included a file called **interact.js** containing all of our smart contract interaction and wallet functions and variables.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript interact.js
  //export const helloWorldContract;

  export const loadCurrentMessage = async () => {

  };

  export const connectWallet = async () => {

  };

  const getCurrentWalletConnected = async () => { 

  };

  export const updateMessage = async (message) => {

  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

At the top of the file, you will notice that we have commented out the *helloWorldContract* object. Later in this tutorial, we will uncomment this object and instantiate our smart contract in this variable, which we will then export into our **HelloWorld.js** component.

The four unimplemented functions after our *helloWorldContract* object do the following:

| Functions                 | Functions Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| loadCurrentMessage        | This function handles the logic of loading the current message stored in the smart contract. It will make a read call to the Hello World smart contract using the [Alchemy Web3 API](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/alchemy-web3). |
| connectWallet             | This function will connect the user's Metamask to our dApp.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| getCurrentWalletConnected | This function will check if an Ethereum account is already connected to our dApp on page load and update our UI accordingly.                                                                                                           |
| updateMessage             | This function will update the message stored in the smart contract. It will make a write call to the Hello World smart contract, so the user's Metamask wallet will have to sign an Ethereum transaction to update the message.        |

Now that we understand what we're working with, let's figure out how to read from our smart contract!

## Step 3: Read from your smart contract

To read from your smart contract, you'll need to set up successfully:

* An API connection to the Ethereum chain.
* A loaded instance of your smart contract.
* A function to call to your smart contract function.
* A listener to watch for updates when the data you're reading from the smart contract changes.

This may sound like a lot of steps, but don't worry! We'll walk you through how to do each of them step-by-step!

### Establish an API connection to the Ethereum Chain

So remember how in Part 2 of this tutorial, we used our [Alchemy Web3 key to reading from our smart contract](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/interacting-with-a-smart-contract#step-1-install-web3-library)? You'll also need an Alchemy Web3 key in your dApp to read from the chain.

If you don't have it already, first install [Alchemy Web3](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/alchemy-web3) by navigating to the root directory of your *starter-files* and running the following in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  npm install @alch/alchemy-web3
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Alchemy Web3 is a wrapper around Web3.js, providing enhanced API methods and other crucial benefits to make your life as a web3 developer easier. It is designed to require minimal configuration so you can start using it in your app right away!
</Info>

For our dApp, **we will be using our Websockets API** key instead of our HTTP API key, as it will allow us to set up a listener that detects when the message stored in the smart contract changes.

![](5aaa4b9-Screenshot_2023-08-29_at_12.15.14_PM.png)

Copy the WebSockets key as displayed above and keep it somewhere safe as you'll be using it in your `interact.js` file as the value of `alchemyKey`.

Now, we're ready to set up our Alchemy Web3 endpoint in our dApp! Let's go back to our `interact.js`, which is nested inside our `util` folder, and add the following code at the top of the file:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript interact.js
  const alchemyKey = "wss://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR-API-KEY>"
  const { createAlchemyWeb3 } = require("@alch/alchemy-web3");
  const web3 = createAlchemyWeb3(alchemyKey); 

  //export const helloWorldContract;
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Above, we included the value of the Alchemy WebSockets key and then passed our **alchemyKey** to createAlchemyWeb3 to establish our Alchemy Web3 endpoint.

With this endpoint ready, it's time to load our smart contract!

### Loading your Hello World smart contract

To load your Hello World smart contract, you'll need its contract address and ABI, both of which can be found on Etherscan if you [completed Part 3 of this tutorial](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/submitting-your-smart-contract-to-etherscan).

![](82ecdc6-contract-abi.gif "contract-abi.gif")

<Check>
  If you skipped Part 3 of this tutorial, you can use the HelloWorld contract with address 0x6f3f635A9762B47954229Ea479b4541eAF402A6A.
</Check>

A contract ABI is necessary for specifying which function a contract will invoke and ensuring that the function will return data in the format you expec . Once we've copied our contract ABI, let's save it as a JSON file called **contract-abi.json** in your *src* directory.

![2880](a3a1446-image_4.png "image (4).png")

The contract-abi.json should be stored in your src folder.

Armed with our contract address, ABI, and Alchemy Web3 endpoint, we can use the [contract method](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth-contract.html?highlight=constructor#web3-eth-contract) to load an instance of our smart contract. Import your contract ABI into the *interact.js* file and add your contract address

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript interact.js
  const contractABI = require("../contract-abi.json");
  const alchemyKey = "wss://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR-API-KEY>"
  const contractAddress = `<Your-Contract-Address>`;
  ```
</CodeGroup>

We can now finally uncomment our **helloWorldContract** variable, and load the smart contract using our AlchemyWeb3 endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript interact.js
  export const helloWorldContract = new web3.eth.Contract(
    contractABI,
    contractAddress
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To recap, the first 12 lines of your interact.js should now look like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript interact.js
  const alchemyKey = "wss://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR-API-KEY>"
  const { createAlchemyWeb3 } = require("@alch/alchemy-web3");
  const web3 = createAlchemyWeb3(alchemyKey); 
  const contractABI = require('../contract-abi.json')
  const contractAddress = `<Your-Contract-Address>`;

  export const helloWorldContract = new web3.eth.Contract(
    contractABI,
    contractAddress
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now that our contract is loaded, we can implement our **loadCurrentMessage** function!

### Implementing loadCurrentMessage in your interact.js file

This function is super simple. Just like we do in [Part 2 of this tutorial series](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/interacting-with-a-smart-contract#step-5-read-the-init-message), we will make a simple async web3 call to read from our contract. Our function will return the message stored in the smart contract:

Update the *loadCurrentMessage* in your `interact.js` file to the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript interact.js
  export const loadCurrentMessage = async () => { 
      const message = await helloWorldContract.methods.message().call(); 
      return message;
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Since we want to display this smart contract in our UI, let's update the *useEffect* function in our **HelloWorld.js** component to the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  //called only once
  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchMessage() {
      const message = await loadCurrentMessage();
      setMessage(message);
    }
    fetchMessage();
  }, []);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Note that we only want our *loadCurrentMessage* to be called once during the component's first render. We'll soon implement `addSmartContractListener` to automatically update the UI after the message in the smart contract changes.

Before we dive into our listeners, let's check out what we have so far! Save your **HelloWorld.js** and **interact.js** files, and then go to `http://localhost:3000/`

You'll notice that the current message no longer says "No connection to the network." Instead, it reflects the message stored in the smart contract. Sick!

![2880](e5c260b-image_5.png "image (5).png")

Your UI should now reflect the message stored in the smart contract

Now, speaking of that listener...

### Implement `addSmartContractListener`

If you think back to the **HelloWorld.sol** file we wrote in Part 1 of this tutorial series, you'll recall that there is a smart contract event called UpdatedMessages that is emitted after our smart contract's update function is invoked (see lines 9 and 27):

<CodeGroup>
  ```sol HelloWorld.sol
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
  // Specifies the version of Solidity, using semantic versioning.
  // Learn more: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/layout-of-source-files.html#pragma
  pragma solidity ^0.7.3;

  // Defines a contract named `HelloWorld`.
  // A contract is a collection of functions and data (its state). Once deployed, a contract resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Learn more: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/structure-of-a-contract.html
  contract HelloWorld {

     //Emitted when update function is called
     //Smart contract events are a way for your contract to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end, which can be 'listening' for certain events and take action when they happen.
     event UpdatedMessages(string oldStr, string newStr);

     // Declares a state variable `message` of type `string`.
     // State variables are variables whose values are permanently stored in contract storage. The keyword `public` makes variables accessible from outside a contract and creates a function that other contracts or clients can call to access the value.
     string public message;

     // Similar to many class-based object-oriented languages, a constructor is a special function that is only executed upon contract creation.
     // Constructors are used to initialize the contract's data. Learn more:https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/contracts.html#constructors
     constructor(string memory initMessage) {

        // Accepts a string argument `initMessage` and sets the value into the contract's `message` storage variable).
        message = initMessage;
     }

     // A public function that accepts a string argument and updates the `message` storage variable.
     function update(string memory newMessage) public {
        string memory oldMsg = message;
        message = newMessage;
        emit UpdatedMessages(oldMsg, newMessage);
     }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Smart contract events are a way for your contract to communicate that something happened (i.e. there was an event) on the blockchain to your front-end application, which can be 'listening' for specific events and take action when they happen.

The **addSmartContractListener** function will specifically listen for our Hello World smart contract's **UpdatedMessages** event, and update our UI to display the new message.

Modify **addSmartContractListener** to the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  function addSmartContractListener() {
      helloWorldContract.events.UpdatedMessages({}, (error, data) => {
        if (error) {
          setStatus("üò• " + error.message);
        } else {
          setMessage(data.returnValues[1]);
          setNewMessage("");
          setStatus("üéâ Your message has been updated!");
        }
      });
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Let's break down what happens when the listener detects an event:

* If an error occurs when the event is emitted, it will be reflected in the UI via our status state variable.
* Otherwise, we will use the *data* object returned. The *data.returnValues* is an array indexed at zero where the first element in the array stores the previous message and the second element stores the updated one. Altogether, on a successful event, we will set our *message* string to the updated message, clear the *newMessage* string, and update our *status* state variable to reflect that a new message has been published on our smart contract.

Finally, let's call our listener in our *useEffect* function to initialize it on the **HelloWorld.js** component's first render. Altogether, your *useEffect* function should look like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchMessage() {
      const message = await loadCurrentMessage();
      setMessage(message);  
    }
    fetchMessage();
    addSmartContractListener();
  }, []);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now that we can read from our smart contract, it would be great to figure out how to write to it too! However, to write to our dApp, we must first have an Ethereum wallet connected to it.

So, next, we'll tackle setting up our Ethereum wallet (Metamask) and then connecting it to our dApp!

## Step 4: Set up your Ethereum wallet

To write anything to the Ethereum chain, users must sign transactions using their virtual wallet's private keys. For this tutorial, we will use [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), a virtual wallet in the browser used to manage your Ethereum account address, as it makes this transaction signing super easy for the end-user.

### Download Metamask

You can download and create a Metamask account for free [here](https://metamask.io/download). When creating an account, or if you already have one, switch to the ‚ÄúSepolia Test Network‚Äù in the upper right (so that we‚Äôre not dealing with real money).

Metamask Dashboard

### Add ether from a Faucet

To sign a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, we‚Äôll need some fake ETH. To get ETH, you can go to the [Sepolia faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) and enter your wallet address, then click ‚ÄúSend Me ETH.‚Äù You should see ETH in your Metamask account soon after!

To deploy our smart contract to the test network, we‚Äôll need some fake ETH. To get ETH, you can go to the [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) and enter your Metamask address, then click ‚ÄúSend Me Eth.‚Äù You should see Eth in your Metamask account soon after!

### Check your Balance

To double check our balance is there, let‚Äôs make an [eth\_getBalance](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/documentation/alchemy-api-reference/json-rpc#eth_getbalance) request using [Alchemy‚Äôs composer tool](https://composer.alchemyapi.io/?composer_state=%7B%22network%22%3A0%2C%22methodName%22%3A%22eth_getBalance%22%2C%22paramValues%22%3A%5B%22%22%2C%22latest%22%5D%7D). This will return the amount of ETH in our wallet. After you input your Metamask account address and click ‚ÄúSend Request‚Äù, you should see a response like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0, "result": "0xde0b6b3a7640000"}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  This result is in Wei, not eth. Wei is used as the smallest denomination of ether. The conversion from Wei to eth is 1 eth = 10¬π‚Å∏ wei. So if we convert 0xde0b6b3a7640000 to decimal we get 1\*10¬π‚Å∏ which equals 1 eth.
</Info>

Phew! Our fake money is all there! ü§ë

## Step 5: Connect Metamask to your UI

Now that our Metamask wallet is set up, let's connect our dApp to it!

### The connectWallet function

In our **interact.js** file, let's implement the *connectWallet* function, which we can then call in our **HelloWorld.js** component.

Let's modify *connectWallet* to the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx interact.jsx
  export const connectWallet = async () => {
    if (window.ethereum) {
      try {
        const addressArray = await window.ethereum.request({
          method: "eth_requestAccounts",
        });
        const obj = {
          status: "üëÜüèΩ Write a message in the text-field above.",
          address: addressArray[0],
        };
        return obj;
      } catch (err) {
        return {
          address: "",
          status: "üò• " + err.message,
        };
      }
    } else {
      return {
        address: "",
        status: (
          <span>
            <p>
              {" "}
              ü¶ä{" "}
              <a target="_blank" href={`https://metamask.io/download`}>
                You must install Metamask, a virtual Ethereum wallet, in your
                browser.
              </a>
            </p>
          </span>
        ),
      };
    }
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

So, what does this giant block of code do exactly?

Well, first, it checks if *window.Ethereum* is enabled in your browser.

<Info>
  window.Ethereum is a global API injected by Metamask and other wallet providers that allows websites to request users' Ethereum accounts. If approved, it can read data from the blockchains the user is connected to, and suggest that the user sign messages and transactions . Check out the [Metamask docs](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html#table-of-contents) for more info!
</Info>

If *window.Ethereum* is not present, that means Metamask is not installed. This results in a JSON object being returned, where the address returned is an empty string, and the *status* JSX object relays that the user must install Metamask.

Now if *window.Ethereum* is present, then that's when things get interesting.

Using a try/catch loop, we'll try to connect to Metamask by calling [window.ethereum.request(\{ method: "eth\_requestAccounts" }); ](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/rpc-api.html#eth-requestaccounts)Calling this function will open up Metamask in the browser, whereby the user will be prompted to connect their wallet to your dApp.

* If the user chooses to connect, *method: "eth\_requestAccounts"* will return an array containing all of the user's account addresses connected to the dApp. Altogether, our *connectWallet* function will return a JSON object that contains the first address in this array (see line 9) and a *status* message that prompts the user to write a message to the smart contract.
* If the user rejects the connection, the JSON object will contain an empty string for the *address* returned and a *status* message reflecting that the user rejected the connection.

Now that we've written this *connectWallet* function, the next step is to call it to our **HelloWorld.js** component.

### Add the connectWallet function to your HelloWorld.js UI Component

Navigate to the *connectWalletPressed* function in **HelloWorld.js**, and update it to the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  const connectWalletPressed = async () => {
      const walletResponse = await connectWallet();
      setStatus(walletResponse.status);
      setWallet(walletResponse.address);
    };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Notice how most of our functionality is abstracted away to our **HelloWorld.js** component from the **interact.js** file? This is so we comply with the M-V-C (Model - View - Controller) paradigm!

In *connectWalletPressed*, we make an await call to our imported *connectWallet* function, and using its response, we update our status and *walletAddress* variables via their state hooks.

Now, let's save both files (**HelloWorld.js** and **interact.js**) and test our UI.

Open your browser on the `http://localhost:3000/` page, and press the "Connect Wallet" button on the top right of the page.

If you have Metamask installed, you should be prompted to connect your wallet to your dApp. Accept the invitation to connect.

You should see that the wallet button now reflects that your address is connected! Yasssss üî• Next, try refreshing the page... this is strange. Our wallet button prompts us to connect Metamask, even though it is already connected...

![944](c2ac7ef-the_problem.gif "the problem.gif")

However, have no fear! We easily can easilycan address that (get it? üòÖ) by implementing *getCurrentWalletConnected*, which will check if an address is already connected to our dApp and update our UI accordingly!

### The `getCurrentWalletConnected` function

Update your getCurrentWalletConnected function in the **interact.js** file to the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx interact.jsx
  export const getCurrentWalletConnected = async () => {
    if (window.ethereum) {
      try {
        const addressArray = await window.ethereum.request({
          method: "eth_accounts",
        });
        if (addressArray.length > 0) {
          return {
            address: addressArray[0],
            status: "üëÜüèΩ Write a message in the text-field above.",
          };
        } else {
          return {
            address: "",
            status: "ü¶ä Connect to Metamask using the top right button.",
          };
        }
      } catch (err) {
        return {
          address: "",
          status: "üò• " + err.message,
        };
      }
    } else {
      return {
        address: "",
        status: (
          <span>
            <p>
              {" "}
              ü¶ä{" "}
              <a target="_blank" href={`https://metamask.io/download`}>
                You must install Metamask, a virtual Ethereum wallet, in your
                browser.
              </a>
            </p>
          </span>
        ),
      };
    }
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This code is very similar to the connectWallet function we just wrote in the previous step.

The main difference is that instead of calling the method *eth\_requestAccounts*, which opens Metamask for the user to connect their wallet, here we call the method *eth\_accounts*, which returns an array containing the Metamask addresses currently connected to our dApp.

To see this function in action, let's call it in the *useEffect* function of our **HelloWorld.js** component:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchMessage() {
      const message = await loadCurrentMessage();
      setMessage(message);
    }
    fetchMessage();
    addSmartContractListener();

    async function fetchWallet() {
      const {address, status} = await getCurrentWalletConnected();
      setWallet(address);
      setStatus(status); 
    }
    fetchWallet();
  }, []);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Notice that we use the response of our call to *getCurrentWalletConnected* to update our *walletAddress* and status state variables.

Now that you've added this code, let's try refreshing our browser window.

![944](7819925-yasss.gif "yasss.gif")

Niceeeee! The button should say that you're connected and show a preview of your connected wallet's address - even after you refresh!

### Implement `addWalletListener`

The final step in our dApp wallet setup is implementing the wallet listener so our UI updates when our wallet's state changes, such as when the user disconnects or switches accounts.

In your **HelloWorld.js** file, modify your *addWalletListener* function as the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx HelloWorld.jsx
  function addWalletListener() {
    if (window.ethereum) {
      window.ethereum.on("accountsChanged", (accounts) => {
        if (accounts.length > 0) {
          setWallet(accounts[0]);
          setStatus("üëÜüèΩ Write a message in the text-field above.");
        } else {
          setWallet("");
          setStatus("ü¶ä Connect to Metamask using the top right button.");
        }
      });
    } else {
      setStatus(
        <p>
          {" "}
          ü¶ä{" "}
          <a target="_blank" href={`https://metamask.io/download`}>
            You must install Metamask, a virtual Ethereum wallet, in your
            browser.
          </a>
        </p>
      );
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

I bet you don't even need our help to understand what's going on here at this point üòâ, but for thoroughness purposes, let's quickly break it down:

* First, our function checks if *window.Ethereum* is enabled (i.e., Metamask is installed).
* If it's not, we set our *status* state variable to a JSX string that prompts the user to install Metamask.
* If it is enabled, we set up the listener *window.ethereum.on("accountsChanged")* on line 3 that listens for state changes in the Metamask wallet, which include when the user connects an additional account to the dApp, switches accounts, or disconnects an account. If at least one account is connected, the *walletAddress* state variable is updated as the first account in the accounts array returned by the listener. Otherwise, *walletAddress* is set as an empty string.

Last but not least, we must call it in our *useEffect* function:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchMessage() {
      const message = await loadCurrentMessage();
      setMessage(message);
    }
    fetchMessage();
    addSmartContractListener();

    async function fetchWallet() {
      const {address, status} = await getCurrentWalletConnected();
      setWallet(address)
      setStatus(status); 
    }
    fetchWallet();
    addWalletListener(); 
  }, []);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

And that's it! We've successfully completed programming all of our wallet functionality! Now, onto our last task: updating the message stored in our smart contract!

## Step 6: Implement the `updateMessage` function

üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èAlrighty fam, we've arrived at the home stretch! In the *updateMessage* of your **interact.js** file, we're going to do the following:

* Make sure the message we wish to publish in our smart contract is valid
* Sign our transaction using Metamask
* Call this function from our HelloWorld.js frontend component

This won't take very long; let's finish this dApp!

### Input error handling

Naturally, it makes sense to have some input error handling at the start of the function.

We'll want our function to return early if there is no Metamask extension installed, there is no wallet connected (i.e., the *address* passed in is an empty string), or the *message* is an empty string. Let's add the following error handling to *updateMessage*:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript interact.js
  export const updateMessage = async (address, message) => {
    if (!window.ethereum || address === null) {
      return {
        status:
          "üí° Connect your Metamask wallet to update the message on the blockchain.",
      };
    }

    if (message.trim() === "") {
      return {
        status: "‚ùå Your message cannot be an empty string.",
      };
    }
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now that it has proper input error handling, it's time to sign the transaction via Metamask!

### Signing our transaction

If you're already comfortable with traditional Web3 Ethereum transactions, the code we write next will be very familiar. Below your input error-handling code, add the following to *updateMessage*:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx interact.js
  //set up transaction parameters
   const transactionParameters = {
      to: contractAddress, // Required except during contract publications.
      from: address, // must match user's active address.
      data: helloWorldContract.methods.update(message).encodeABI(),
    };

  //sign the transaction
    try {
      const txHash = await window.ethereum.request({
        method: "eth_sendTransaction",
        params: [transactionParameters],
      });
      return {
        status: (
          <span>
            ‚úÖ{" "}
            <a target="_blank" href={`https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/${txHash}`}>
              View the status of your transaction on Etherscan!
            </a>
            <br />
            ‚ÑπÔ∏è Once the transaction is verified by the network, the message will
            be updated automatically.
          </span>
        ),
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        status: "üò• " + error.message,
      };
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Let's break down what's happening. First, we set up our *transactions* parameters, where:

* **to** specifies the recipient address (our smart contract)
* **from** specifies the signer of the transaction, the address variable we passed into our function
* **data** contains the call to our Hello World smart contract's update method, receiving our message string variable as input. Then, we make an await call, *window.Ethereum.request*, where we ask Metamask to sign the transaction. Notice that lines 11 and 12 specify our eth method, *eth\_sendTransactionand* passing in our *transactionParameters*.

At this point, Metamask will open up in the browser and prompt the user to sign or reject the transaction.

* If the transaction is successful, the function will return a JSON object where the status JSX string prompts the user to check out Etherscan for more information about their transaction.
* If the transaction fails, the function will return a JSON object where the status string relays the error message.

Altogether, our *updateMessage* function should look like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```jsx interact.jsx
  export const updateMessage = async (address, message) => {

    //input error handling
    if (!window.ethereum || address === null) {
      return {
        status:
          "üí° Connect your Metamask wallet to update the message on the blockchain.",
      };
    }

    if (message.trim() === "") {
      return {
        status: "‚ùå Your message cannot be an empty string.",
      };
    }

    //set up transaction parameters
    const transactionParameters = {
      to: contractAddress, // Required except during contract publications.
      from: address, // must match user's active address.
      data: helloWorldContract.methods.update(message).encodeABI(),
    };

    //sign the transaction
    try {
      const txHash = await window.ethereum.request({
        method: "eth_sendTransaction",
        params: [transactionParameters],
      });
      return {
        status: (
          <span>
            ‚úÖ{" "}
            <a target="_blank" href={`https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/${txHash}`}>
              View the status of your transaction on Etherscan!
            </a>
            <br />
            ‚ÑπÔ∏è Once the transaction is verified by the network, the message will
            be updated automatically.
          </span>
        ),
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        status: "üò• " + error.message,
      };
    }
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Last but not least, we need to connect our *updateMessage* function to our **HelloWorld.js** component.

### Connect `updateMessage` to the HelloWorld.js frontend

Our *onUpdatePressed* function should make an await call to the imported *updateMessage* function and modify the *status* state variable to reflect whether our transaction succeeded or failed:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript HelloWorld.js
  const onUpdatePressed = async () => {
      const { status } = await updateMessage(walletAddress, newMessage);
      setStatus(status);
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

It's super clean and simple. üòåAnd guess what...YOUR DAPP IS COMPLETE!!!

Let's test out the "Update" button!
