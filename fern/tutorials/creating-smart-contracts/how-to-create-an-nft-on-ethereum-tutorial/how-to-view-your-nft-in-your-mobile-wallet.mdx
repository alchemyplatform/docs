*Estimated time to complete this guide: ~3 minutes*

Congrats! You've made it to the shortest and simplest part of our NFT tutorial series: how to view your freshly minted NFT in your virtual wallet. We'll be using Metamask for this example since it is what we used in the previous two parts.

As a prerequisite, you should already have Metamask on mobile installed, and it should include the account to which you minted your NFT â€” you can get the app for free on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask-blockchain-wallet/id1438144202), or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask\&hl=en_US\&gl=US).

## Step 1: Set your network to Sepolia

At the top of the app, press the *Wallet* button, after which you'll be prompted to select a network. As our NFT was minted on the Sepolia network, you'll want to select Sepolia as your network.

## Step 2: Add your collectible to Metamask

Once you're on the Sepolia network, select the *NFTs* tab on the right and add the NFT smart contract address and the ID of your NFTâ€” which you should be able to find on Etherscan based on the transaction hash from your [NFT minted in Part II](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-a-nft-smart-contract/how-to-mint-a-nft) of our tutorial.

You may need to refresh a couple of times to view your NFT â€”but it will be there! ðŸ˜„
