Transaction Simulation is a powerful feature that helps users understand the exact impact of a transaction before it is executed on the blockchain. With Alchemy's Simulation APIs, you can gain insights into asset transfers, emitted logs, and internal calls of a transaction before actually sending it to the blockchain. This not only enhances usability but also increases confidence in the integrity of transactions.

Alchemy's Transaction Simulation supports multiple networks, including Ethereum (Mainnet and Goerli), Polygon (Mainnet and Mumbai), Arbitrum (Mainnet and Goerli) and Optimism (Mainnet and Goerli).

<Info>
  Please note that the results provided by our transaction simulation APIs are based on the blockchain's state at the moment of simulation. Changes in the blockchain state, such as updates to contract variables or balances, can occur between the time of simulation and when you actually execute your transaction.

  This could lead to different outcomes than predicted. For instance, if a transaction's effect is conditional on the current state of a contract, and this state is altered before the transaction is executed, the final result may not match the simulation.

  Please be aware of this potential variance and consider it while using the APIs.
