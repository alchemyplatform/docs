Implementing Simulation APIs is as easy as adding 1 line to your code base.

If you are already signing transactions via `eth_signTransaction` or any calling any other method that takes an unsigned transaction object, all you need to do is pass the object to `alchemy_simulateAssetChanges`.

## eth\_signTransaction

<CodeGroup>
  ```json eth_signTransaction
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_signTransaction",
    "id": 1,
    "params": [
      {
        "from": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
        "to": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
        "value": "0x0",
        "data": "0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000fc43f5f9dd45258b3aff31bdbe6561d97e8b71de00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f4240"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Replace `eth_signTransaction` with `alchemy_simulateAssetChanges` to get simulation results.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json alchemy_simulateAssetChanges
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "alchemy_simulateAssetChanges",
    "id": 1,
    "params": [
      {
        "from": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
        "to": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
        "value": "0x0",
        "data": "0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000fc43f5f9dd45258b3aff31bdbe6561d97e8b71de00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f4240"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

That's it!
