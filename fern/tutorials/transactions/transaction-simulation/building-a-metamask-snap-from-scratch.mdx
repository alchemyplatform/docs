We built a MetaMask Snap to showcase the power of Transaction Simulation.

We added an extra tab *Alchemy Insights* to MetaMask to let users know the exact impact of their transaction **before** they hit the blockchain.

Check out a quick demo [here](https://www.loom.com/share/719db9c1345648ab83169cc0f7eb7ed2).

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to build your own. Coming soon ðŸ‘€
