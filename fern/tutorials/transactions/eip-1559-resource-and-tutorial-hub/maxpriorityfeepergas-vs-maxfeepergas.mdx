Sending a transaction on Ethereum post London fork uses these two new gas price fields: [`maxFeePerGas`](/docs/maxpriorityfeepergas-vs-maxfeepergas#what-is-maxfeepergas-a-hrefand-finally-what-is-max-fee-per-gas-idand-finally-what-is-max-fee-per-gasa) and [`maxPriorityFeePerGas`](/docs/maxpriorityfeepergas-vs-maxfeepergas#what-is-maxpriorityfeepergas-a-hrefwhat-is-max-priority-fee-per-gas-idwhat-is-max-priority-fee-per-gasa). We won't go into detail on the incentive theory behind fee markets here. Instead, we will dive into the difference between these two fields and when you might want to use one vs the other (or both).

If you've gone through our [tutorial on sending an EIP 1559 transaction](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/guides/eip-1559/send-tx-eip-1559) then you've seen that we recommend using only the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` field. We did this for simplicity, but it's not always the better field to use.

To understand why, let's look at each of the concepts more in-depth.

## What is the `baseFeePerGas`?

Let's start with understanding what a base fee is. The base fee is the bare minimum you will be charged to send a transaction on the network. The base fee is set *by the network itself*, not by miners. The base fee changes block by block, based on how full the previous block was.

Post London fork, each block has a `baseFeePerGas` associated with it. You can see the base fee for the pending (upcoming) block with:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  web3.eth.getBlock("pending").then((block) => console.log("baseFee", Number(block.baseFeePerGas)));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The above snippet assumes you've set up your [Alchemy Web3 client](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/documentation/alchemy-web3). If you haven't , check out the [EIP 1559 tutorial](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/sending-txs/eip-1559) for some sample code.

## What is [`maxPriorityFeePerGas`](../../apis/ethereum/eth-maxpriorityfeepergas.md)?

Base fees are determined by the network and are also burned when the block is mined. This means that the miner does not get the base fee as a reward for mining a block.

Miners are still compensated for the computational work by receiving a "tip". When you submit a transaction you will also provide this "tip" in the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` field.

The bare minimum you should tip the miner is 1 wei so that there is an incentive for the miner to execute the transaction. The higher your tip, the more likely your transaction will be included in the block.

## What is `maxFeePerGas`?

Now that we know about the base fee and tip, `maxFeePerGas` is super simple. It's just the sum of the two:

`maxFeePerGas = baseFeePerGas + maxPriorityFeePerGas`

## When to use `maxPriorityFeePerGas` vs. `maxFeePerGas`?

The most *guaranteed* way to have your transaction included in the block is to specify a `maxPriorityFeePerGas` field (which is a tip). In this case, Alchemy will look up the pending `baseFee` and then set the `maxFeePerGas` field accordingly (to the sum of the base fee and the tip). All you have to do is decide how much tip to provide, which you can get by simply calling the `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` method on Alchemy.

This method is the simplest but it may not be the cheapest. There are two dimensions to consider when submitting your transaction: **speed** and **cost.** If you bid high, you get mined earlier. If you bid low, you get mined later or not at all.

When you submit only the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` field, the defaults will fill in the base fee for you. The base fee depends on how full the previous blocks were. If many of the previous blocks were full, then the base fee can end up being quite high! Since the value is added automatically, you can end up paying a surprisingly high gas price.

To avoid this pitfall you can supply the `maxFeePerGas` field. If you supply *only* this field, then the tip will be filled in for you but there are no guarantees on *when* your transaction will be mined. You can also supply both the `maxFeePerGas` and the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` fields for full control.

## Example using maxFeePerGas

Let's put all of the concepts together by submitting a transaction that is guaranteed to fail. By setting the `maxFeePerGas` to less than the sum of `baseFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`. This code is an extension of the code in the [EIP 1559 transaction sending tutorial](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/guides/eip-1559/send-tx-eip-1559).

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  web3.eth.estimateGas({
    to: toAddress,
    data: "0xc6888fa10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003"
  }).then((estimatedGas) => {
    web3.eth.getMaxPriorityFeePerGas().then((tip) => {
      web3.eth.getBlock("pending").then((block) => {
        const baseFee = Number(block.baseFeePerGas);
        const max = Number(tip) + baseFee - 1; // less than the sum

        sendTx(web3, {
          gas: estimatedGas,
          maxPriorityFeePerGas: Number(tip),
          maxFeePerGas: max,
          to: toAddress,
          value: 100,
        });
      });
    });
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The output is just a constant stream of "waitingâ€¦"

```shell
Transaction sent! 0x7648502609b5617fc23fac9daf92a10e8c5ecdd8fe709132c2ce50899685072a

```

You will now have to wait until the base fee of a block drops low enough that the sum of the base fee plus tip is less than your `maxFeePerGas`. Depending on network congestion, the wait time can be very long.

## Conclusion

Choosing to use `maxPriorityFeePerGas` vs. `maxFeePerGas` for sending transactions is completely dependent on what your priorities are. If you care about speed and want to get your transaction into the earliest block possible, you should use the default base fee and just set (a high) `maxPriorityFeePerGas`.

If you care more about saving on gas, and less about transaction speed, you can set your own `maxFeePerGas` and potentially risk the transaction getting mined at a later block (or earlier block if you choose to set it to be higher than the base fee + tip).
