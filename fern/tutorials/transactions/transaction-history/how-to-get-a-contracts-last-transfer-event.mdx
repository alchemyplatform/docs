Script to Get a Contract's Last Transfer Event

Open Recipe

Have you ever wanted to know what's going on under the hood of a smart contract? One way to get insight into how a smart contract is used is to track a contract's transfer events. This allows you to examine how users/addresses interact with it.

In this guide, you will query the last transfer even of the BAYC smart contract, though you may choose another contract of your preference.

The following is a list of potential use cases:

* Create an NFT tracker for reporting on the latest trades.
* Create a DeFi tracker of a particular dex to get the latest transfer info or provide current information.
* Create Crypto Whale Twitter bot.
* Create the transfer history of a particular address or smart contract.
* Build smart contract logic that requires the most up-to-date transfer info.

***

## Install Node.js

Head to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the LTS version.

You can verify your installation was successful by running `npm -version` in your macOS terminal or Windows command prompt. A successful installation will display a version number, such as:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  6.4.1
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

## Setup Project Environment

Open VS Code (or your preferred IDE) and enter the following in terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  mkdir contract-transfers
  cd contract-transfers
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Once inside our project directory, initialize npm (node package manager) with the following command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  npm init
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Press enter and answer the project prompt as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json contract-transfers.json
  package name: (contract-transfers)
  version: (1.0.0)
  description: 
  entry point: (index.js)
  test command: 
  git repository: 
  keywords: 
  author: 
  license: (ISC)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Press enter again to complete the prompt. If successful, a `package.json` file will have been created in your directory.

***

## Install Alchemy's SDK

[Alchemy's SDK](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart) allows us to more efficiently interact with Alchemy's endpoints and make JSON-RPC requests.

Ensure you are inside your project folder and type the following command in the terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Get Contract's Last Transfer Event

In this section, we will use Alchemy's \[Transfer API]ref:transfers-api) to retrieve the contract's last transfer event. The Alchemy SDK allows us to call the [`alchemy_getAssetTransfers`](/reference/alchemy-getassettransfers) function and filter transfers by passing in the following object parameters:

| Property            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Requirements | Default                |

| `excludeZeroValue`  | A boolean to exclude transfers of zero value. A zero value is not the same as `null`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Optional     | `true`                 |

If more results are available after the response, a `uuid` property will return. You can use this in subsequent requests to retrieve the next 1000 results of `maxCount`. | Optional     |                        |

For reference, here is an example of how the above parameters could be passed into `getAssetTransfers`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript FirstTransfer.js
  alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers({
      fromBlock: "0x0",
      toBlock: "latest",
      contractAddresses: ["0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"],
      excludeZeroValue: true,
      category: ["erc721"],
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To get started finding a contract's first transfer, let's create a file inside our project folder named `FirstTransfer.js` and add the following code to utilize the [`alchemy_getAssetTransfers`](/reference/alchemy-getassettransfers) endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript FirstTransfer.js
  // Setup: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const config = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->",
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,
  };
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const getFirstTransfer = async () => {
    // Calling the getAssetTransfers function and filters using the following parameters
    const allTransfers = await alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers({
      fromBlock: "0x0",
      contractAddresses: ["0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"], // You can replace with contract of your choosing
      excludeZeroValue: true,
      category: ["erc721"],
    });

    // printing the first indexed transfer event to console
    console.log("First Transfer:", allTransfers.transfers[0]);
  };

  getFirstTransfer();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Above, we created an async function called *`getFirstTransfer`*.To learn more about how what it does, view the commented notes above.

To use your script, type the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node FirstTransfer.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If successful, you should see the following transfer object in your output:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    blockNum: '0xbc61b7',
    hash: '0xb74538f871af833485fd3e62c5b53234403628e3be5ae369385ee24bf546f0df',
    from: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
    to: '0x7772881a615cd2d326ebe0475a78f9d2963074b7',
    value: null,
    erc721TokenId: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003b7',
    erc1155Metadata: null,
    tokenId: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003b7',
    asset: 'BAYC',
    category: 'erc721',
    rawContract: {
      value: null,
      address: '0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d',
      decimal: null
    }
  }
  Page key: 915e662f-a7ca-4c4f-a5e9-0bbf2c6a53f1
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If your output includes a `page key`, you can use the value for pagination in subsequent requests. If you've received the latest transfer event, your result will not include a page key and reads as:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  Page key: none
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In that scenario, congratulations, you've successfully queried some of the latest transfer events!

However, in our case, we did receive a UUID page key. This is because the BAYC contract contains more than 1000 transfer events (the maximum allowed per `getAssetTransfers` request). To learn more about how to use page keys, continue on to the following section.

***

## Use Page Keys

To account for potential page keys, we will create a loop to check whether `getAssetTransfer` returns a page key. If it does, the loop will continuously call `getAssetTransfers` until a page key no longer returns.

To do this, we need to reorganize our code to make room for the while loop. Remove lines 18-25 of `LastTransfer.js`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript LastTransfer.js
  // Setup: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const config = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->",
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,
  };
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const getLastTransfer = async () => {
    const getTransfers = alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers({
      fromBlock: "0x0",
      toBlock: "latest",
      contractAddresses: ["0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"],
      excludeZeroValue: true,
      category: ["erc721"],
    });
    const firstPage = await getTransfers;
    // *** remove these lines ***
    const firstPageLength = firstPage.transfers.length;
    console.log(firstPage.transfers[firstPageLength - 1]);
    let pageKey = firstPage.pageKey;
    if (pageKey) {
      console.log("Page key: " + pageKey);
    } else {
      console.log("Page key: none");
    }
    // *** ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ***
  };

  getLastTransfer();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now, replace lines 18-25 with the following code block:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript LastTransfer.js
  let pageKey = firstPage.pageKey;

    try {
      if (pageKey) {
        let counter = 0;
        while (pageKey) {
          const nextKey = alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers({
            fromBlock: "0x0",
            toBlock: "latest",
            contractAddresses: ["0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"],
            excludeZeroValue: true,
            category: ["erc721"],
            pageKey: pageKey.toString(),
          });

          const nextPage = await nextKey;
          pageKey = nextPage.pageKey;

          if (pageKey) {
            counter += 1;
            console.log("Request #" + counter + " made!");
            continue;
          } else {
            const nextPageLength = nextPage.transfers.length;
            const transferCount = counter * 1000 + nextPageLength;
            console.log("Last BAYC token transfer(#" + transferCount + "):");
            console.log(nextPage.transfers[nextPageLength - 1]);
            break;
          }
        }
      } else if (pageKey === undefined) {
        const firstPageLength = firstPage.transfers.length;
        console.log(firstPage.transfers[firstPageLength - 1]);
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.log("Something went wrong with your request: " + err);
    }
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
  To dive into the loop's details, check out the commented code above.

Your entire `LastTransfer.js` script should look like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript LastTransfer.js
  // Setup: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const config = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->",
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,
  };
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const getLastTransfer = async () => {
    const getTransfers = alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers({
      fromBlock: "0x0",
      toBlock: "latest",
      contractAddresses: ["0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"],
      excludeZeroValue: true,
      category: ["erc721"],
    });

    const firstPage = await getTransfers;
    let pageKey = firstPage.pageKey;

    try {
      if (pageKey) {
        let counter = 0;
        while (pageKey) {
          const nextKey = alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers({
            fromBlock: "0x0",
            toBlock: "latest",
            contractAddresses: ["0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"],
            excludeZeroValue: true,
            category: ["erc721"],
            pageKey: pageKey.toString(),
          });

          const nextPage = await nextKey;
          pageKey = nextPage.pageKey;
          
          if (pageKey) {
            counter += 1;
            console.log("Request #" + counter + " made!");
            continue;
          } else {
            const nextPageLength = nextPage.transfers.length;
            const transferCount = counter * 1000 + nextPageLength;
            console.log("Last BAYC token transfer(#" + transferCount + "):");
            console.log(nextPage.transfers[nextPageLength - 1]);
            break;
          }
        }
      } else if (pageKey === undefined) {
        const firstPageLength = firstPage.transfers.length;
        console.log(firstPage.transfers[firstPageLength - 1]);
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.log("Something went wrong with your request: " + err);
    }
  };

  getLastTransfer();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To test our script, run the following code in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node LastTransfer.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If successful, your script should log each request:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  Request #1 made!
  Request #2 made!
  Request #3 made!
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Once your script loops through the contract's entire transfer history, you should see an output similar to the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json ouput
  ...
  Request #73 made!
  Request #74 made!
  Request #75 made!
  Last BAYC token transfer(#75016):
