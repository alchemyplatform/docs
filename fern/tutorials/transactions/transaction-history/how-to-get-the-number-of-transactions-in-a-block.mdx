*This guide assumes you've gone through the [getting started](https://alchemyenterprisegroup.readme.io/docs/alchemy-quickstart-guide) steps and have an [Alchemy account!](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=50d2691677)*

<Info>
  This tutorial uses the **[eth\_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber](/reference/eth-getblocktransactioncountbynumber)** endpoint.
</Info>

Each Block in a Blockchain is assigned a block number. It is the unique sequential number for each Block. Follow the steps below to return all transactions in the current finalized Block on Ethereum:

## 1. From your command line, create a new project directory and cd into it:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  mkdir get-num-block-txns
  cd get-num-block-txns
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Install the Alchemy SDK if you have not already

You can use any web3 library of your choosing. However, there are tons of benefits to using the [Alchemy SDK](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart). In this guide, we will make use of the [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) library as well.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk axios
  ```

  ```text yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Create a file named index.js and add the following contents:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  const options = {
    method: "POST",
    url: "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/{your-api-key}",
    headers: { accept: "application/json", "content-type": "application/json" },
    data: {
      id: 1,
      jsonrpc: "2.0",
      method: "eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber",
      params: "finalized",
    },
  };

  axios
    .request(options)
    .then(function (response) {
         console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      console.error(error);
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This is an `axios` call, where a POST request is made to the Alchemy API and the `data` sent contains the particular endpoint called

```
method: "eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber",
```

And the param which specifies, returning information on the most recent finalized Block:

```
params: "finalized",
```

## 4. Run it using node

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You will see the following response logged to the console:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  { jsonrpc: '2.0', id: 1, result: '0xb3' }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This response is in HEX. To view it in decimal, you can add a simple convert function to the code:

## 5. Converting HEX to Decimal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  function hexToDec(hex) {
    return parseInt(hex, 16);
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Convert the `result` response from Hexademical to Decimal. Target the `result` by updating the response in the then block.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  . . . .
   result = response.data.result;
   console.log(hexToDec(result));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The result will be returned as a number in the console:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  179
  ```
</CodeGroup>
