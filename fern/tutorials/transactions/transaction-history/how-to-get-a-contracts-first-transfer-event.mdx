<Info>
  This tutorial uses the **[alchemy\_getAssetTransfers](/reference/alchemy-getassettransfers)** endpoint.
</Info>

One of the best ways to study a smart contract is to look at its transfer events. In this tutorial, we will query the very first transfer event of the BAYC smart contract. However, you are welcome to use any contract address you are interested in!

See the following for use cases for retrieving a contract's first transfer event:

* Finding the first addresses to interact with a contract (e.g., the first address to mint a Bored Ape).
* Tracking the first interaction an address had with a smart contract.
* Verifying whether a contract facilitated transfers before a certain date.

***

## Install Node.js

Head to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the LTS version.

You can verify your installation was successful by running `npm -version` in your macOS terminal or Windows command prompt. A successful installation will display a version number, such as:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  6.4.1
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

## Setup Project Environment

Open VS Code (or your preferred IDE) and enter the following in a terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  mkdir contract-transfers
  cd contract-transfers
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Once inside our project directory, initialize npm (node package manager) with the following command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  npm init
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Press enter and answer the project prompt as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json contract-transfers.json
  package name: (contract-transfers)
  version: (1.0.0)
  description: 
  entry point: (index.js)
  test command: 
  git repository: 
  keywords: 
  author: 
  license: (ISC)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Press enter again to complete the prompt. If successful, a `package.json` file will have been created in your directory.

***

## Install Alchemy's SDK

[Alchemy's SDK](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart) allows us to efficiently interact with Alchemy's endpoints and make JSON-RPC requests.

Ensure you are inside your project folder, then type the following command in terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Get Contract's First Transfer Event

In this section, we will use Alchemy's [Transfer API](/reference/transfers-api) to retrieve the contract's first transfer event. The Alchemy SDK allows us to call the [`alchemy_getAssetTransfers`](/reference/alchemy-getassettransfers) function and filter transfers by passing in the following object parameters:

| Property            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Requirement | Default                |

| `excludeZeroValue`  | A boolean to exclude transfers of zero value. A zero value is not the same as `null`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Optional    | `true`                 |

If more results are available after the response, a `uuid` property will return. You can use this in subsequent requests to retrieve the next 1000 results of `maxCount`. | Optional    |                        |

For reference, here is an example of how the above parameters could be passed into `getAssetTransfers`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript FirstTransfer.js
  alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers({
      fromBlock: "0x0",
      toBlock: "latest",
      contractAddresses: ["0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"],
      excludeZeroValue: true,
      category: ["erc721"],
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To get started finding a contract's first transfer, let's create a file inside our project folder named `FirstTransfer.js` and add the following code to utilize the [`alchemy_getAssetTransfers`](/reference/alchemy-getassettransfers) endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript FirstTransfer.js
  // Setup: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const config = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->",
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,
  };
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const getFirstTransfer = async () => {
    // Calling the getAssetTransfers function and filters using the following parameters
    const allTransfers = await alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers({
      fromBlock: "0x0",
      contractAddresses: ["0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"], // You can replace with contract of your choosing
      excludeZeroValue: true,
      category: ["erc721"],
    });

    // printing the first indexed transfer event to console
    console.log("First Transfer:", allTransfers.transfers[0]);
  };

  getFirstTransfer();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Above, we created an async function called *`getFirstTransfer`*. To learn more about how what it does, view the commented notes above.

To use your script, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node FirstTransfer.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If successful, you should see the following transfer object in your output:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json output
  First Transfer: {
    blockNum: '0xbb933a',
    hash: '0xcfb197f62ec5c7f0e71a11ec0c4a0e394a3aa41db5386e85526f86c84b3f2796',
    from: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
    to: '0xaba7161a7fb69c88e16ed9f455ce62b791ee4d03',
    value: null,
    erc721TokenId: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
    erc1155Metadata: null,
    tokenId: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
    asset: 'BAYC',
    category: 'erc721',
    rawContract: {
      value: null,
      address: '0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d',
      decimal: null
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Congratulations, you've successfully retrieved the first transfer event in the BAYC contract!
