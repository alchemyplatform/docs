# Introduction

On-chain events are important because they represent a permanent and unchangeable record of what happened on the blockchain. This provides a level of trust and transparency that is crucial for many use cases, such as financial transactions and voting systems. By recording events on the blockchain, it is possible to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data, as well as to ensure that it cannot be tampered with or altered. This makes on-chain events a valuable tool for building secure and reliable applications on the blockchain.
