<Info>
  This tutorial uses the **[alchemy\_minedTransactions](/reference/alchemy-minedtransactions)** subscription endpoint.
</Info>

Alchemy provides the most effective method to subscribe to mined transactions, log events, and new blocks using WebSockets on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. By leveraging the Alchemy SDK, you're able to access direct subscription types by simply connecting to each endpoint. \[mined

In this tutorial, we will test and create a sample project using the [`alchemy_minedTransactions`](/reference/alchemy-minedtransactions) method offered by the [Alchemy SDK](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart).

**What relevance does the `alchemy_minedTransactions` provide to users?**

* Tracking transactions being mined and notify users via SMS - [Alchemy Notify API](/reference/notify-api-quickstart)
* Display all transactions within the Ethereum network on a rolling basis

**How does `alchemy_minedTransactions` compare to `[alchemy_pendingTransactions](ref:alchemy-pendingTransactions)`?** Although both these Subscription API endpoints emit full transaction objects or hashes and filter based on specified parameters, they serve two different objectives. The `alchemy_minedTransactions` returns entire transactions that are **mined** on the network whereas `alchemy_pendingTransactions` returns transactions that are **sent** to the network and marked as **pending**.

Developers can enhance the requests with specific parameters including:

* `addresses`(optional): Singular address or array of addresses **to** receive pending transactions sent from this address.
* `includeRemoved`(optional): Singular address or array of addresses **from** receive pending transactions sent from this address.
* `hashesOnly`(optional - default set to `false`): The response matches the payload of [eth\_getTransactionByHash](/reference/eth-gettransactionbyhash). This is information about a transaction by the transaction hash including `blockHash`, `blockNumber` and `transactionIndex`. If set to `true`, the payload will return only the hashes of the mined transactions.

## Step 0: Configure your developer environment

Before you begin, complete the following steps to [set up your web3 developer environment](/docs/how-to-set-up-core-web3-developer-tools).

1\. Install [Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/)(> 14) on your local machine

2\. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your local machine

3\. Install [wscat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) on your local machine

To check your Node version, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node -v
  ```
</CodeGroup>

4\. [Create a free Alchemy account](https://alchemy.com/?a=mined-tx-sub)

## Step 1: Open your Alchemy App

Once your Alchemy account is created, there will also be a default app that is also created.

To create another Alchemy app, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1\&v=tfggWxfG9o0\&feature=emb_logo).

## Step 2: Get WebSocket URL from Alchemy App

Once you have created your app, get your WebSocket URL that we will use later in this tutorial.

1. Click on your app's **View Key** button in the dashboard
2. Copy and save the **WebSocket URL**

## Step 3: Output Mined Transactions Using wscat

**Wscat** is a terminal or shell tool used to connect to the WebSockets server. Each Alchemy application will provide a WebSocket URL that can be used directly with the wscat command.

1. Initiate the WebSocket stream
2. Enter the specific call command

The following example will use the `demo` key, but should be replaced with your key from Step 2.

From your terminal, run the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell wscat
  // initiate websocket stream first and replace demo with your key
  wscat -c wss://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/demo 

  // no param specification - return all mined txs  
  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id": 2, "method": "eth_subscribe", "params": ["alchemy_minedTransactions"]}

  // to and from filters, hashesOnly = true
  {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_subscribe","params": ["alchemy_minedTransactions", {"addresses": [{"to": "0x9f3ce0ad29b767d809642a53c2bccc9a130659d7", "from": "0x228f108fd09450d083bb33fe0cc50ae449bc7e11"}, {"to": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"}],"includeRemoved": false,  "hashesOnly": true}],"id": 1}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If successful, you should see output that looks something like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Results
  {"id":1,"result":"0xf13f7073ddef66a8c1b0c9c9f0e543c3","jsonrpc":"2.0"}

  // hashesOnly = true
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_subscription",
    "params": {
      "result": {
              "removed": false
              "transaction": {
                  "hash":"0xa8f2cf69e302da6c8100b80298ed77c37b6e75eed1177ca22acd5772c9fb9876",
              }
      },
      "subscription": "0xf13f7073ddef66a8c1b0c9c9f0e543c3"
    }
  }

  // hashesOnly = false
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_subscription",
    "params": {
      "result": {
              "removed": false
              "transaction": {
            "blockHash":"0xbe847be2bceb74e660daf96b3f0669d58f59dc9101715689a00ef864a5408f43",
                  "blockNumber":"0x5b8d80",
                  "hash":"0xa8f2cf69e302da6c8100b80298ed77c37b6e75eed1177ca22acd5772c9fb9876",
                  "from":"0x2a9847093ad514639e8cdec960b5e51686960291",
                  "gas":"0x4f588",
                  "gasPrice":"0xc22a75840",
                  "input":"0x000101d521928b4146",
                  "nonce":"0x9a2",
                  "r":"0xb5889c55a0ebbf86627524affc9c4fdedc4608bee7a0f9880b5ec965d58e4264",
                  "s":"0x2da32e817e2483ec2199ec0121b93384ac820049a75e11b40d152fc7558a5d72",
                  "to":"0xc7ed8919c70dd8ccf1a57c0ed75b25ceb2dd22d1",
                  "transactionIndex":"0x14",
                  "type":"0x0",
                  "v":"0x1c",
                  "value":"0x0"
              }
      },
      "subscription": "0xf13f7073ddef66a8c1b0c9c9f0e543c3"
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

By using **wscat**, you are able to verify the transaction immediately via the computer's terminal or shell.

## Step 4: Create a Node project

To build out a kick starter that leverages the **alchemy-sdk**, let's create an empty repository and install all node dependencies.

To make requests to the SDK WebSockets Endpoints, we recommend using the [Alchemy SDK Quickstart](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart).

From your terminal, run the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Alchemy SDK
  mkdir mined-transactions && cd mined-transactions
  npm init -y
  npm install --save alchemy-sdk
  touch main.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will create a repository named `mined-transactions` that holds all the files and dependencies we need.

Open this repo in your preferred code editor, where we'll write our code in the `main.js` file.

## Step 5: Output Pending Transactions using alchemy-sdk

Next, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to use the Alchemy SDK to create an **alchemy\_minedTransactions** subscription.

To make requests using Alchemy's minedTransactions API, we recommend reviewing the [alchemy\_minedTransactions docs](/reference/alchemy-minedtransactions).

Next, add the following code to the `main.js` file, using your Alchemy API key:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Alchemy SDK
  // Installation: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network, AlchemySubscription } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const settings = {
    apiKey: "demo", // Replace with your Alchemy API Key
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

  // Subscription for Alchemy's minedTransactions API
  alchemy.ws.on(
    {
      method: AlchemySubscription.MINED_TRANSACTIONS,
    },
    (tx) => console.log(tx)
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Run this script by running the following command in your terminal:

`node main.js`

It should look something like this:

<Warning>
  If successful, you should see a stream of transactions as the result. This stream of output indicates the **all transactions** that are mined on the Ethereum Mainnet.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Results
  {
    removed: false,
    transaction: {
      blockHash: '0x1a6adfef39de127f52cd451af2352a97c06cccdd6afe3a30bfa26c45165de74d',

      to: '0x974caa59e49682cda0ad2bbe82983419a2ecc400',
      transactionIndex: '0xae',
      value: '0x32e997e5e977820',
      type: '0x0',
      chainId: '0x1',
      v: '0x25',
      r: '0x89b952803c6e94e4caaaaa3c82d426d40fdc5471019a9ff550fc006a546a8537',

    }
  }
  {
    removed: false,
    transaction: {
      blockHash: '0x1a6adfef39de127f52cd451af2352a97c06cccdd6afe3a30bfa26c45165de74d',
      blockNumber: '0xf25e13',

      maxFeePerGas: '0x4486199b4',
      maxPriorityFeePerGas: '0x4486199b4',
      hash: '0x1c22aee60a6121ce29073a1771155216ccee54962cb235c0ec8d71b6449dd708',
      input: '0x2d2da806000000000000000000000000accbbf7a2189a56c0dfd10bb37d8316d300dbcd4',
      nonce: '0x4',
      to: '0xabea9132b05a70803a4e85094fd0e1800777fbef',
      transactionIndex: '0xaf',

      type: '0x2',
      accessList: [],

      v: '0x1',
      r: '0x7a7a294c5844a2b16f8b2cd5ddc3b748e3ab89215f6974f82910d95d5707b47a',
      s: '0x79f17cec79d3a66b89780345831408288c9a2c535548c5df35fd9df0692ab5a3'
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 6: Filter Pending Transactions

Next, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to filter pending transactions using the **alchemy\_minedTransactions** subscription. The filters will input an address or an array of addresses that will output mined transactions based on the parameters. These filters are (`fromAddress`) indicating the address that will send the transaction and (`toAddress`) indicating the address that will receive the transaction.

Add the following code to the `main.js` file, using your Alchemy API key:

<Warning>
  Within the Subscription API method, we've added three filters: addresses, includeRemoved and hashesOnly. This will enable our request to the Alchemy minedTransactions API to be filtered based on the parameters that we've assigned.

  Here is what each filter is doing:
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Alchemy SDK
  // Installation: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network, AlchemySubscription } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const settings = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->", // Replace with your Alchemy API Key
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

  // Subscription for Alchemy's minedTransactions API
  alchemy.ws.on(
    {
      method: AlchemySubscription.MINED_TRANSACTIONS,
      addresses: [
        {
          from: "0x473780deaf4a2ac070bbba936b0cdefe7f267dfc",
        },
        {
          to: "0x473780deaf4a2ac070bbba936b0cdefe7f267dfc",
        },
      ],
      includeRemoved: true,
      hashesOnly: false,
    },
    (tx) => console.log(tx)
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>
