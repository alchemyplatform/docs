[alchemy\_pendingTransactions](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/alchemy-pendingtransactions)

Alchemy provides the most effective method to subscribe to pending transactions, log events, and new blocks using WebSockets on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. By leveraging the Alchemy SDK, you're able to access direct subscription types by simply connecting to each endpoint.

In this tutorial, we will test and create a sample project using the `alchemy_pendingTransactions` method offered by the Alchemy SDK.

**What relevance does the `alchemy_pendingTransactions` provide to users?**

* Watching for pending transactions sent to a set of NFT owners to track the most recent floor price
* Watching transactions sent from a whale trader to track trading patterns

**How does `alchemy_pendingTransactions` compare to `newPendingTransactions`?** Both these subscription types enable developers to receive transaction hashes that are sent to the network and marked as "pending". However, `alchemy_pendingTransactions`enhance the developer experience by providing filters that can specify based on to/from addresses. This greatly improves the readability of the transaction requests received.

It allows for strengthened requests with specific parameters given by the user including:

* `toAddress`(optional): Singular address or array of addresses **to** receive pending transactions sent from this address.
* `fromAddress`(optional): Singular address or array of addresses **from** receive pending transactions sent from this address.
* `hashesOnly`(optional - default set to `false`): The response matches the payload of [eth\_getTransactionByHash](/reference/eth-gettransactionbyhash). This is information about a transaction by the transaction hash including `blockHash`, `blockNumber` and `transactionIndex`.

## Step 0: Configure your developer environment

Before you begin, complete the following steps to [set up your web3 developer environment](/docs/how-to-set-up-core-web3-developer-tools).

1\. Install [Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/)(> 14) on your local machine

2\. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your local machine

3\. Install [wscat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) on your local machine

To check your Node version, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node -v
  ```
</CodeGroup>

4\. [Create a free Alchemy account](https://alchemy.com/?a=d3d4c6ebf1)

## Step 1: Open your Alchemy App

Once your Alchemy account is created, there will also be a default app that is also created.

To create another Alchemy app, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1\&v=tfggWxfG9o0\&feature=emb_logo).

## Step 2: Get WebSocket URL from Alchemy App

Once you have created your app, get your WebSocket URL that we will use later in this tutorial.

1. Click on your app's **View Key** button in the dashboard
2. Copy and save the **WebSocket URL**

## Step 3: Output Pending Transactions Using wscat

**Wscat** is a terminal or shell tool used to connect to the WebSockets server. Each Alchemy application will provide a WebSocket URL that can be used directly with the wscat command.

1. Initiate the WebSocket stream
2. Enter the specific call command

From your terminal, run the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell wscat
  // initiate websocket stream first
  wscat -c wss://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo

  // then call subscription 
  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id": 2, "method": "eth_subscribe", "params": ["alchemy_pendingTransactions", {"toAddress": ["0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48", "0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7"], "hashesOnly": false}]}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If successful, you should see output that looks something like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Results
  {"id":1,"result":"0xf13f7073ddef66a8c1b0c9c9f0e543c3","jsonrpc":"2.0"}

  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_subscription",
    "params": {
      "result": {
        "blockHash": null,
        "blockNumber": null,
        "from": "0x098bdcdc84ab11a57b7c156557dca8cef853523d",
        "gas": "0x1284a",
        "gasPrice": "0x6fc23ac00",
        "hash": "0x10466101bd8979f3dcba18eb72155be87bdcd4962527d97c84ad93fc4ad5d461",
        "input": "0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000054406f1ec84f89532f83768f3f159b73b237257f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c9c380",
        "nonce": "0x11",
        "to": "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
        "transactionIndex": null,
        "value": "0x0",
        "type": "0x0",
        "v": "0x26",
        "r": "0x93ddd646056f365352f7e53dfe5dc81bde53f5b7c7bbe5deea555a62540d6995",
        "s": "0x79ed82a681930feb11eb68feccd1df2e53e1b96cf9171ae4ffcf53e9b2a40e8e"
      },
      "subscription": "0xf13f7073ddef66a8c1b0c9c9f0e543c3"
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

By using **wscat**, you are able to verify the transaction immediately via the computer's terminal or shell.

## Step 4: Create a Node project

To build out a kick starter that leverages the **alchemy-sdk**, let's create an empty repository and install all node dependencies.

To make requests to the SDK WebSockets Endpoints, we recommend using the [Alchemy SDK Quickstart](/reference/sdk-websockets-endpoints).

From your terminal, run the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Alchemy SDK
  mkdir pending-transactions && cd pending-transactions
  npm init -y
  npm install --save alchemy-sdk
  touch main.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will create a repository named `pending-transactions` that holds all the files and dependencies we need.

Open this repo in your preferred code editor, where we'll write our code in the `main.js` file.

## Step 5: Output Pending Transactions using alchemy-sdk

Next, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to use the Alchemy SDK to create an **alchemy\_pendingTransactions** subscription.

To make requests using Alchemy's pendingTransactions API, we recommend reviewing the [alchemy\_pendingTransactions docs](/reference/alchemy-pendingtransactions).

Next, add the following code to the `main.js` file, using your Alchemy API key:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Alchemy SDK
  // Installation: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network, AlchemySubscription } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const settings = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->", // Replace with your Alchemy API Key
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

  // Subscription for Alchemy's pendingTransactions API
  alchemy.ws.on(
    {
      method: AlchemySubscription.PENDING_TRANSACTIONS,
    },
    (tx) => console.log(tx)
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Run this script by running the following command in your terminal:

`node main.js`

If successful, you should see a stream of transactions as the result. This stream of output indicates the latest (pending or mined) transactions hitting the Ethereum Mainnet. It should look something like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Results
  {
    blockHash: null,
    blockNumber: null,
    from: '0x0dd25571522e0ac38712b56834dc6081cde33325',

    to: '0x000054d3a0bc83ec7808f52fcdc28a96c89f6c5c',
    transactionIndex: null,
    value: '0x0',
    type: '0x0',
    v: '0x27125',
    r: '0x5466a7a7d1823c2290fc4803cac0340dcab34e843a8c0681763ca60fd7ccc7b2',

  }
  ....
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 6: Filter Pending Transactions

Next, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to filter pending transactions using the **alchemy\_pendingTransactions** subscription based on an address or array of addresses to receive pending transactions sent **from** this address (`fromAddress`) and **to** this address (`toAddress`).

Add the following code to the `main.js` file, using your Alchemy API key:

<Warning>
  Within the Subscription API method, we've added two new filters fromAddress and toAddress. This will enable our request to the Alchemy pendingTransaction API to be filtered based on the parameters that we've assigned.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Alchemy SDK
  // Installation: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network, AlchemySubscription } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const settings = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->", // Replace with your Alchemy API Key
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

  // Subscription for Alchemy's pendingTransactions API
  alchemy.ws.on(
    {
      method: AlchemySubscription.PENDING_TRANSACTIONS,
      fromAddress: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48", // Replace with address to recieve pending transactions from this address
      toAddress: "0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7", // Replace with address to send  pending transactions to this address
    },
    (tx) => console.log(tx)
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>
