Here's a breakdown of the options available:

* **Auto-scaling**: This feature allows for unlimited on-demand API access after your prepaid amount is utilized. This is particularly useful if you have varying API needs that might exceed your prepaid amount. If this is not active, your API access will be turned off once your prepaid amount is reached.

* **Max auto-scaling spend limit**: This is an optional spend limit when auto-scaling is activated. By setting this limit, your service will automatically stop once this amount is reached, ensuring you don't incur unexpected costs. You can set this limit either in Dollars or Compute Units (CUs)..

### 4. Setting your preferences

**Step 4:** Configure the auto-scale options based on your requirements and you're all set!
