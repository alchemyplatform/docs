# What is the Alchemy Sandbox?

The Alchemy Sandbox is a tool that allows users to simulate blockchain method calls using Alchemy's API endpoints. It is designed to streamline the development and debugging process for Web3 applications by providing an interactive "play" environment to build and test calls against Alchemy's supported blockchain networks.

# How to set up a request on Alchemy Sandbox

Setting up a method request on Alchemy's sandbox is easy. Let's set up a simple `eth_getBalance` request on Ethereum mainnet:

1. 1. Visit the [Alchemy Sandbox](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/sandbox) in the Dashboard

2. Click the `Select an app` dropdown and select your application if you want the simulated request to use your app's API key, allowing you to test your key and analytics directly if needed. Otherwise, you can leave the default `Sandblox Demo App` as the selection.

3. In the `Chain and network` section, select the chain and its respective network. Since we want to get the latest block number on Ethereum mainnet, we will select `Ethereum` and `Ethereum mainnet`.

4. The `Category` section is useful if you want to see what methods are available for each API category supported on the selected chain. You'll notice toggling the `Chain and Network` selection to `Arbitrum` will reduce the Categories available down, indicating what APIs are supported on that chain. For now, you can leave it blank as we are only setting up a simple request.

5. If not already selected, make sure to toggle to the `eth_getBalance` in the `Method` section of the Sandbox.

You will notice this is a powerful component of the Sandbox, as you can select any method to test out.

5. Your request is now fully set up! Select `Send Request`! ðŸš€

You can change any of the parameters, like the `Address` or `Block`, if you would like to do further testing. This is a fully customizable "Sandbox" experience. As you change parameters, you'll notice the `Request preview` section on the right side of the screen also adapts to your changes.

You can also immediately jump to that endpoint's documentation by selecting `View docs`.

You will notice a `Response` section appear:

The balance for the address `0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73` is `0.000000000000003285 ether`.

# Further testing using Alchemy's Sandbox

Alchemy's Sandbox provides a powerful and user-friendly environment for testing your Web3 applications without the need for local setup or private infrastructure. Whether you're validating requests to Alchemyâ€™s APIs, experimenting across supported chains, or debugging contract interactions, the Sandbox enables faster iteration and smoother development. It's a valuable resource for developers looking to prototype, test, and refine their dApps with confidenceâ€”before going live.
