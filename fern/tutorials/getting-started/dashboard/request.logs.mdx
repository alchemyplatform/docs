This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use the Request Logs feature in the Alchemy Dashboard to monitor and debug JSON-RPC API requests. 

### Why It Matters
The Request Logs feature in the Alchemy Dashboard is a powerful tool for developers building on different blockchains. It solves several critical problems:

* **Debugging Made Easy**: Request Logs provides a user-friendly interface to search, filter, and analyze historical API requests, saving hours of manual debugging compared to raw log files or custom scripts.
* **Transparency and Control**: Developers gain visibility into every JSON-RPC request sent through Alchemy's infrastructure, including successes, failures, and errors, helping identify bottlenecks or misconfigured requests.
* **Performance Optimization**: By analyzing request durations, error rates, and method usage, developers can optimize dApp performance and ensure a seamless user experience.

Request Logs empowers developers to maintain reliable dApps, reduce downtime, and improve user satisfaction with actionable insights into API interactions.

#### Overview of the Request Logs Feature
The Request Logs feature, accessible via the Alchemy Dashboard's Request Explorer, allows you to view and analyze all JSON-RPC requests made to Alchemy's API endpoints for your application. Key functionalities include:

**Search and Filter**: Filter requests by parameters such as:
* **App**: Filter by a specific app.
* **Network**: Filter by a specific blockchain network.
* **Method**: Specific JSON-RPC methods (e.g., `eth_blockNumber`, `eth_getLogs`).
* **HTTP Response**: Success (2xx) or error codes (4xx, 5xx).
* **JSON-RPC Error code**: Filter by specific error codes.
* **All errors**: See all requests that resulted in an error.
* **Response time**: Time taken for the request to complete.
* **JSON-RPC ID**: Filter by a specific request ID.

**Detailed Request View**: Inspect individual requests to see:
* Request payload and response.
* Error messages (if any).
* Node-specific details or network errors.

To access Request Logs:

1. Log in to the Alchemy Dashboard.
2. Navigate to the tools section on the sidebar.
3. Click request logs to enter the request logs dashboard.

#### Code Samples
Below are code samples to help you interact with Alchemy's API and troubleshoot issues using insights from Request Logs.
##### Sample 1: Fetching the Latest Nonce Before Sending a Transaction
If Request Logs show "nonce too low" errors for eth_sendRawTransaction, use this code to fetch the latest nonce:
```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY");

async function getLatestNonce(walletAddress) {
  try {
    const nonce = await provider.getTransactionCount(walletAddress, "latest");
    console.log(`Latest nonce: ${nonce}`);
    return nonce;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching nonce:", error);
  }
}

// Example usage
getLatestNonce("0xYourWalletAddress");
```
**Usage**: Run this before sending a transaction to ensure the correct nonce. Check Request Logs to confirm eth_getTransactionCount requests succeed (HTTP 200).
##### Sample 2: Batching Requests to Avoid Rate Limits
If Request Logs show HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors, batch requests using the Alchemy SDK:
```javascript
const { Network, Alchemy } = require("alchemy-sdk");

const settings = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,
};
const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

async function batchRequests() {
  try {
    const batch = [
      { method: "eth_blockNumber", params: [] },
      { method: "eth_getBalance", params: ["0xYourWalletAddress", "latest"] },
    ];
    const responses = await alchemy.core.send("batch", batch);
    console.log("Batch responses:", responses);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Batch request failed:", error);
  }
}

batchRequests();
```
**Usage**: Batching reduces the number of requests, lowering the chance of hitting rate limits. Monitor Request Logs for fewer eth_blockNumber and eth_getBalance entries.

### Best Practices
#### Pro Tips

* **Use Specific Filters**: Combine filters (e.g., method + error code) to quickly isolate issues in Request Explorer.
* **Monitor Regularly**: Check Request Logs daily or use Alchemy's Notify API for real-time alerts on errors.
* **Leverage Timestamps**: Filter by timestamp to focus on specific timeframes when debugging reported issues.

#### Limits

* **Data Retention**: Logs are available for up to 10 days. Export logs regularly for longer-term analysis.
* **Rate Limits**: HTTP 429 errors indicate rate limit breaches. Optimize with batching or upgrade your plan.
* **Block Range for eth_getLogs**: Limit eth_getLogs block ranges (e.g., 5,000 blocks) to avoid timeouts.

#### Common Issues and Solutions

* **Issue**: HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) in logs.
	* **Solution**: Use batch requests (see Sample 2) or reduce request frequency.
* **Issue**: "Nonce too low" errors in eth_sendRawTransaction.
	* **Solution**: Fetch the latest nonce before each transaction (see Sample 1).
* **Issue**: Empty or missing logs.
	* **Solution**: Verify API key, app, and network filters. Check for dashboard delays during high network congestion.

#### Additional Notes

* **Security**: Avoid exposing API keys in client-side code. Use HTTP header-based authentication.
* **Documentation**: See Alchemy's Error Reference for JSON-RPC error codes.
* **Support**: Contact Alchemy Support via the dashboard or check the FAQ.

By leveraging Request Logs and these practices, you can monitor, debug, and optimize your dApp's API interactions for a reliable user experience.
