Alchemy is your complete web3 development platform. Whether you're accessing blockchain data, building smooth, web2-like dApp experiences or launching your own rollup, we have everything you need.

This guide is designed to help you get started across our major product areas. Feel free to jump to the section that interests you most:

1. [Node APIs](#node-apis)
2. [Data: APIs, Subgraphs & Webhooks](#data-apis-subgraphs--webhooks)
3. [Account Kit](#account-kit)
4. [Rollups](#rollups)

## Node APIs

Node APIs are the standard JSON-RPC endpoints exposed by blockchain clients. We support **45+ chains** today, with new ones added every month.

### Getting Started:

1. **Grab your API key** from the [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com).
2. **Make your first request** to any [supported JSON-RPC endpoint](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/chain-apis-overview). For example:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey} \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_blockNumber",
  "params": [],
  "id": 1
}'
```

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "1",
  "result": "0x2377"
}
```

This works with any HTTP library â€” `axios`, `fetch`, and more.

## Data: APIs, Subgraphs & Webhooks

### Data APIs

These are high-level APIs built by us to simplify blockchain development. Unlike standard Node APIs, these are powerful abstractions that return rich data in fewer requests.

We provide Data APIs for:

* NFTs
* Tokens
* Transactions
* Prices
* Transfers
* And more â€” across multiple networks.

**Example: Get NFTs for an address**

```bash
curl -G https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/nft/v3/${apiKey}/getNFTsForOwner \
     -d owner=0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
```

This endpoint returns all NFTs owned by a wallet â€” perfect for NFT galleries, dashboards, and marketplaces.

***

### Subgraphs

Need custom, complex queries? Subgraphs let you define your own GraphQL APIs over blockchain data.

Check out our [Subgraphs Quickstart](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/subgraphs-quickstart) to learn how to build and deploy them on Alchemy Subgraphs.

***

### Webhooks

When polling isn't enough, Webhooks let you receive **real-time on-chain event notifications**. Use them to stream:

* Wallet activity at scale
* Smart contract events
* Full block data (incl. traces)

Webhooks are [**customizable using GraphQL-style filters**](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/custom-webhook) so you only get the data you care about.

ðŸ“˜ Dive into the [Webhooks Quickstart](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/notify-api-quickstart) to get started.

ðŸ‘‰ Explore all of our Data capabilities [here](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/api-overview).

## Account Kit

Want to create seamless, web2-like experiences for your web3 app? **Account Kit** makes it simple.

With the Account Kit SDK, you can:

* Offer **social logins**
* Enable **gas-sponsored transactions**
* Support **invisible signing** for users

It works with React, React Native, and other JS frameworks.

ðŸŽ¬ Try the [Demo App](https://demo.alchemy.com/) to see what's possible.

### Sample Code: Create a Smart Account + Sponsored Tx

```ts
// yarn add @account-kit/infra @account-kit/smart-contracts
import {
  alchemy,
  createAlchemySmartAccountClient,
  sepolia,
} from "@account-kit/infra";
import { createLightAccount } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
import { LocalAccountSigner } from "@aa-sdk/core";
import { generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts";

const alchemyTransport = alchemy({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // from Alchemy dashboard
});

export const client = createAlchemySmartAccountClient({
  transport: alchemyTransport,
  policyId: "YOUR_POLICY_ID", // create a gas policy in the dashboard
  chain: sepolia,
  account: await createLightAccount({
    chain: sepolia,
    transport: alchemyTransport,
    signer: LocalAccountSigner.privateKeyToAccountSigner(generatePrivateKey()),
  }),
});
```

## Rollups

Want to launch your own chain? Alchemy Rollups let you deploy a production-grade rollup in minutes â€” no code required.

You'll get a dedicated chain with full control over cost, speed, and functionality, plus built-in RPCs, block explorer and developer tools.

We support major frameworks including **OP Stack**, **Arbitrum Orbit**, and **zkSync ZK Stack**.
