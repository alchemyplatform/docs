[Solflare](https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/solflare) is one of the most [popular wallets on Solana for developers](https://www.alchemy.com/list-of/wallets-on-solana). As the first non-custodial wallet for the Solana blockchain, it gives users access to their private keys and complete control over their funds.

Transactions on a public RPC endpoint may experience latency and rate limits (i.e. throughput) as more people join the network to participate and build, which might necessitate the need for a [private Solana endpoint](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solana-rpc) to scale.

Whether you’re just [setting up your Solana developer tools for the first time](/docs/how-to-setup-your-solana-development-environment), or need improved Solana node performance, this article will explain how to add a custom Solana RPC endpoint to your wallet with Alchemy.

## 0. Prerequisites

Here is what you’ll need to complete this tutorial:

* A [free Alchemy account](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=2c36b9f0c8)
* [Solfare extension](https://solflare.com/) installed on your PC

## Step 1. Set up your Private Solana Node on Alchemy

First head over to the Alchemy dashboard and create a new account. During the signup process, choose **Solana** as the type of app you want to create.

If you are an existing user, sign in and create a new Solana app.

#### Here is the information you need to create a Solana app:

1. **Name** - Project’s Name
2. **Chain** - Solana
3. **Network** - Mainnet

From the dashboard, you can view and copy your HTTP Key. This is what we’ll use in the next section to add a custom RPC endpoint in your Solflare wallet.
