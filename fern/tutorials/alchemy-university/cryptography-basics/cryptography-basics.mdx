While "crypto" has entered the lexicon as a shorthand for "blockchain-based digital currency", it's fundamentally important to understand the role of cryptography in blockchains and cryptocurrencies.

**This section will cover the basics of cryptography for blockchains:**

1. [What is Public Key Cryptography?](/docs/public-key-cryptography)
2. [What is a hashing algorithm?](/docs/hashing-algorithm)
3. [How do tree data structures work?](/docs/tree-data-structures)
4. [What are Merkle Trees?](/docs/what-are-merkle-trees)
5. [How are Merkle Trees used in blockchains?](/docs/merkle-trees-in-blockchains)
6. [What are Patricia Merkle Tries?](/docs/patricia-merkle-tries)

If this sounds too technical, don't worry, we've broken it down into the simplest pieces.

Take your time, and don't stress out over memorizing all of the nitty gritty details.
