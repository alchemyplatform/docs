A good hashing algorithm is a function that will take any sized input and reduce it down to a nearly unique fixed-sized output.

Hashing has its uses outside of [cryptography](/docs/public-key-cryptography), most notably for data storage in hash tables (see [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)). For our purposes, we're going to be focused on hashing algorithms that are suitable for cryptography. üîë

### Cryptographic Hashing Algorithms

Let's take a look at some of the properties of cryptographic hashing algorithms.

1. **Given the same input, they produce the same output**

   For example, no matter how many times I pass `Hello World` into the [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hashing algorithm I will always get back `a591a6d40bf420404a011733cfb7b190d62c65bf0bcda32b57b277d9ad9f146e`.

2. **Given a slightly different input, a completely different output is returned**

   In the example above, we used `Hello World`. If we were to change this slightly, the hash produced would look completely different!

   Some examples:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```javascript javascript
     sha256("Hello World"); // a591a6‚Ä¶9f146e
     sha256("hello World"); // db4067‚Ä¶4e7d7e
     sha256("Hello  World"); // 60ab93‚Ä¶cf11b3
     sha256("Hello World!"); // 7f83b1‚Ä¶6d9069
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   üëÜüèº Whether we added an additional space, exclamation mark, *or even changed capitalization*, the output will always be completely different.

   <Info>
     The returned results here are shown in hexadecimal format. It's a pretty common standard for displaying data in cryptography for convenience reasons: every two characters represents a byte and it is more compact than a long string of 1s and 0s with binary.

3. **They should be one-way**

   Starting with an output like `ffd85b0d22019d89837d841224eb51166dbdb43f8f4fbd18baf96c78cd721d4c` you would have no way of finding out what input creates this output. The only thing you could do is **guess**, which is referred to as a brute-force attack. Good luck! That might take you a while.

4. **Collisions should be extremely rare**

   It should nearly impractical to find two inputs that map to the same output. And once again, the only way to do so should be through guessing.

These properties make for some really awesome cryptographic solutions. We'll frequently refer to hashes when discussing [blockchain](/docs/what-is-a-blockchain). Cryptographic hashes are super cool! üòé

<Info>
  It's fun to try out SHA256. Try typing "SHA256 online" or "SHA256 generator" into Google to find a quick tool that will take messages and return the SHA256 hash. You should be able to come up with the hashes shown in the examples above and create your own!
