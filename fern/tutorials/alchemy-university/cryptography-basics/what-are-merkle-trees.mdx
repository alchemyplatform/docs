Now it's time to talk about an important data structure: **Merkle Trees**. As we take a look at [Ethereum Data Storage](/docs/what-is-ethereum) and as we build smart contracts, we'll often find ourselves interfacing with this data structure and we'll be expected to understand its usefulness.

**Ok, tell it to me straight! What is a Merkle Tree and what does it do?**

Quite simply, a Merkle Tree is a data structure that allows us to make efficient verifications that data belongs in a larger set of data.

They are commonly used in [Peer to Peer networks](/docs/what-are-blockchain-networks) where efficient [proofs](/docs/proof-of-work) of this nature will help increase the scalability of the network.

Let's take a step back and take a look at a binary Merkle Tree from a high level. A Merkle Tree is a collection of hashes reduced to a single hash:

```text
      ABCDEFGH <-- Merkle Root
       /    \
    ABCD     EFGH
    / \      / \
   AB  CD   EF  GH
  / \  / \  / \ / \
  A B  C D  E F G H
```

We use letters for convenience in this illustration. Each single letter represents a hash. The combined letters represent concatenated hashes that have been combined and hashed to form a new hash.

Over a series of steps the eight-leaf hashes `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, and `H` are combined to create a single, unique hash that allows us to quickly check for inconsistencies without having to look at each individual data point.

As peers in a system, I can simply ask if your root matches mine. If so, we agree. This is a nice optimization for distributed systems of any kind!

Now, if we're just comparing roots, you might be asking:

**Why the [tree structure](/docs/tree-data-structures)? Could we not concatenate all eight hashes at once and store that hash?**

Great question! We certainly could. This binary tree structure affords us one further optimization: it allows us to verify a single piece of data belongs in the tree **without having all of the data**. Consider the Merkle tree from above with some missing data:

```shell
      ABCDEFGH
       /    \
    ABCD     EFGH
    / \      / \
   -  -     EF  GH
  / \  / \  / \ / \
  - -  - -  E F -  -
```

**What do we need in order to prove that `E` belongs in this tree?**

Just `F`, `GH`, `ABCD`. We use these to calculate `EF`, `EFGH`, and `ABCDEFGH`. Then we can compare the result to our expected root `ABCDEFGH` .

If something went wrong along the way, we would notice it at the root. For example if we replaced E with M:

```shell
      ABCDMFGH
       /    \
    ABCD     MFGH
    / \      / \
   -  -     MF  GH
  / \  / \  / \ / \
  - -  - -  M F -  -
```

We can quickly check `ABCDMFGH` against our expected root `ABCDEFGH` and see we did not get our expected hash. Something's wrong.

The savings become important with larger trees where the average case for verification of a tree is `log2(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. So for a tree of size 128, it would take only 7 hashes to determine the root.
