Let's dive into a Solidity-specific data structure, not typically found in other programming languages like `arrays` are... 🤨

## Structs

![structures](Structure-gc58a04cb9_1280.jpg)

Up until now, we've looked at all of the *defined* data types in Solidity. One super cool feature about Solidity is it allows you to define ***your own custom data type*** 🤯.

You can define your own custom data type by creating a **`struct`**. Struct types are typically used to represent a *record*, or a grouping of common data.

The syntax to declare a struct in Solidity [resembles an object declaration in JavaScript](/docs/solidity-vs-javascript):

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  struct structName {
     type1 typeName1;
     type2 typeName2;
     type3 typeName3;
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Super easy! 💯 Let's look at a specific use case for structs to help us further understand the concept..

### Struct Use Cases: Library Record Keeping 📚

What if we wanted to have an immutable record of all the library books we cared about? 🤔 Keeping our book records on a centralized server somewhere might not be ideal, since it might be taken down or corrupted by the server admin. In come smart contracts! 💥

We can create a smart contract called `Library` and equip it with all the functionality we'd need to perform detailed record keeping for books. For now, we can just work off of a single assumption / user story:

#### - For each book record I add to my `Library` smart contract, I want to keep track of its `title`, `author` and some sort of `id` for internal record-keeping

The above assumption would mean lines and lines of code... if we didn't have Solidity structs. 😉

So, let's define a [smart contract](/docs/how-does-solidity-work) called `Library` and define a struct called `Book` inside its scope. The `Book` struct should keep track of all the properties we listed in the assumption above:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  contract Library {

      struct Book {
          string title;
          string author;
          uint bookId;
      }

  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Great! We've got the base setup done. Any further functionality will be structured around this same `Book` struct and its properties.

A `Book` struct is specific to *one* book... so we need a way to keep track of many of the same type... anything ring a bell here? 🔔 That's right, we can use an array. Let's add it to our `Library`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  contract Library {

      struct Book {
          string title;
          string author;
          uint bookId;
      }

      Book[] public books;
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Sweet! An array here will make it super easy to keep indexed track of each `Book` struct, along with each book's specific properties.

What if we want to add a book? We can do so with a function `addBook()`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  contract Library {

      struct Book {
          string title;
          string author;
          uint bookId;
      }

      Book[] public books;

      function addBook(string memory _title, string memory _author) public {
          books.push(Book(_title, _author, books.length));
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Ok, let's break down the `addBook()` function real quick:

* The `string` parameters use `memory`. This is a requirement of Solidity whenever you use reference types as a parameter, you must precede the parameter with either `memory` or `calldata`. This is just telling the Solidity compiler where the data being passed in lives. Since this is an ephemeral call, we are passing in the value from `memory`.

* We use `books.push()` in order to push a brand new Book struct

* We initialize the struct by calling it exactly like you would a function: `Book(_param1, param2, ...)` - that is the easiest one but you can also initialize structs like so:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
      // key value mapping
      todos.push(Todo({text: _text, completed: false}));
      
      // initialize an empty struct in local memory and then update it
      Todo memory todo;
      todo.text = _text;
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Ok great! We can now add new books to our library and push em to the `books` array for record-keeping. What if we want to retrieve a book from this record? We can add a simple getter and retrieve based on the `bookId`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  contract Library {

      struct Book {
          string title;
          string author;
          uint bookId;
      }

      Book[] public books;

      function addBook(string memory _title, string memory _author) public {
          books.push(Book(_title, _author, books.length));
      }
      
      function get(uint _bookId) public view returns (string memory _title, string memory _author) {
          return(books[_bookId].title, books[_bookId].author);
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Awesome! Now anyone can pass in a book id and the smart contract will return that book id's title and author! 💃

One final function to add before we wrap up the awesomeness of structs is `update()`, that way we can update a book title or author for any reason (mainly for an easy example, since we probably wouldn't want to update such a record after it's been sealed!).

**But wait!**

**One more thing...** notice how all of our functions are `public`? This means anyone could mess with our cool library and we don't want that! Let's make it so that each `Book` holds an `address` property, and ONLY that specific address can perform certain changes in the contract:

Let's add a `registrant` of type `address` on the `Book` struct. Let's also add an `update()` function:

<Info>
  Be careful! Since we are adding a new property to the `Book` struct, we will have to change any previous calls to `Book` to also account for it! 🚨
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  contract Library {

      struct Book {
          string title;
          string author;
          uint bookId;
          address registrant;
      }

      Book[] public books;

      function addBook(string memory _title, string memory _author) public {
          // whoever adds a book, that is the registrant on this book
          books.push(Book(_title, _author, books.length, msg.sender));
      }
      
      function get(uint _bookId) public view returns (string memory _title, string memory _author) {
          return(books[_bookId].title, books[_bookId].author);
      }
      
      function update(uint _bookId, string memory _newTitle, string memory _newAuthor) public {
          // protect our book record by only making
          // this function available to the original registrant
          require(msg.sender == books[_bookId].registrant, 'You must have been the one to add the book to change the record!');
          
          books[_bookId].title = _newTitle;
          books[_bookId].author = _newAuthor;
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Amazing. We've just coded a whole contract that has soooo much functionality in so few lines! 🤯 Plus, it protects our records by checking the `msg.sender` in the `update()` function! 🔐

## Conclusion

Structs are super useful in Solidity. They are a custom data type... so they are fitting for any custom record-keeping needs you might think of! Another example would be a `Player` struct that keeps track of that player's `address`, `level`, etc...
