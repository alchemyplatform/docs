Use ExpressJS to create a server with endpoints for HTTP verbs. Parse JSON input with `app.use()` and test with axios library.

Let's create our own **JSON REST API** for [Ethereum](/docs/what-is-ethereum)!

Essentially, this means we'll create a server that will respond to certain HTTP verbs:

* **GET** - Get a resource or a list of resources
* **POST** - Create a new resource
* **PUT** - Update a resource
* **DELETE** - Delete a resource

## Setting Up üì¶

Create a new folder for this project. Call it whatever you like!

Once you've created the folder, navigate to it in the terminal and create a `package.json`. You can do so with:

```shell
npm init -y
```

üëÜüèº This will create a new `package.json` where we can install all our dependencies. Next, install [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html). This library will help us quickly spin up REST endpoints:

```shell
npm install express
```

## The Server üíª

Let's create the server now! Create a new folder inside the project called `server` and add an `index.js` inside of it.

Afterward, your directory structure should look like this:

```shell
node_modules
server
  index.js
package.json
package-lock.json
```

Now inside the `index.js` file, let's create our REST API. First, let's try to respond to a simple `GET` request.

### The GET Request

Let's get a simple "Hello World" example working. Copy the following code into your `index.js` file:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  const port = 3000;

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello World");
  });

  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

üëÜüèº This will respond to a `GET` request at the base route `/` with the raw string "Hello World". You can test this out by running the server with `node`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node index
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This should log `"Listening at http://localhost:3000"`. If you go to that [localhost URL](http://localhost:3000) you should find the message "Hello World" waiting for you.

<Info>
  A tip! Use the [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package to run your server and you won't need to restart the server every time you change your code. **Nodemon will do this for you!**
</Info>

Next, let's change what we're returning in `app.get` to be some **resource**:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const things = [];
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(things);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

üëÜüèº Now we should return `things` instead of "Hello World". Test it out!

### The POST Request

Next, let's **create a thing**!

First, we'll need to add an endpoint to our server which will take user input to create a new `thing`.

In addition to our `app.get` endpoint, let's add an `app.post` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  // be sure to include this line so express will parse JSON input
  app.use(express.json());

  app.post('/', (req, res) => {
    things.push(req.body);
    res.send(things);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

üëÜüèº This **POST** endpoint will allow us to take the **body** of the request and push it onto our `things` array. Then it will send a response with all of the `things` included.

<Info>
  Be sure to include the `app.use` line. This is using [express middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) which will know how to properly handle a JSON request.
</Info>

OK, now we have our **POST** endpoint set up. Let's make a request to our server!

## Making the Request

Next, let's create a new top-level folder called `scripts` and add a `create.js` inside of it. Your directory structure should look like this afterward:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell
  node_modules
  scripts
    create.js
  server
    index.js
  package.json
  package-lock.json
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Let's install the `axios` library to easily run our POST request:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  npm install axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Inside of this `create.js` let's add the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  const newThing = { name: "Thing1" }

  axios.post('http://localhost:3000/', newThing).then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

üëÜüèº Here we are creating a new thing and POSTing it to our server running at port 3000.

For this step, you'll need to keep the server running on port 3000 while also running the `create.js` script. Navigate to the `/scripts` folder in your terminal and run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node create
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Did it work? If it did, you should have created a new thing and received in the response. Run it again, and you get two things! üéâ

## Challenge 1: Customize üé®

Customize the REST API. Can you turn the `thing` resource into something you would actually want to create a server around?

You could use the dictionary example from our first week, or TODOs, or a game, or virtual currency! Whatever you like, this is *your REST API*!

Be sure to give the resource some additional properties other than a `name`!

## Challenge 2: DELETE Request ‚öîÔ∏è

For this challenge, you will need to implement a **DELETE** method on the API.

The express library has a [delete method](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.delete.method) on the `app` which you can use to create the endpoint on the server.

Then you will want to create a new script that you will use to delete one of the things on the server. Axios also has a [delete method](https://github.com/axios/axios#axiosdeleteurl-config-1) you can use to run the request.

Something to think about: how should you identify the resource? ü§î

Perhaps each resource could have a specific `id` property to identify it by! üí°

<Warning>
  Every time you restart the server, the variables stored in memory will be re-initialized unless you store it to your file system or some other kind of database.
</Warning>

## Challenge 3: PUT Request ‚öîÔ∏è

For this challenge, you will need to implement a **PUT** method on the API. The **PUT** method should **update a particular resource**. Once again, you'll want a way to identify which resource you are referring to so the server knows which one to update!

The express library has a [put method](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.put.method) on the `app` which you can use to create the endpoint on the server.

Then you will want to create a new script that you will use to delete one of the things on the server. Axios also has a [put method](https://github.com/axios/axios#axiosputurl-data-config-1) you can use to run the request.

Then you will want to create a new script that you will use to update one of the things on your server.
