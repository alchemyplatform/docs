Ethereum is a layer one blockchain that supports smart contracts. To become a web3 developer, understanding the basics of Ethereum's network and consensus mechanism is essential.

**This section of Alchemy University covers:**

1. [What is Ethereum?](/docs/what-is-ethereum)
2. [What is Proof-of-Stake?](/docs/what-is-proof-of-stake)
3. [How does Ethereum gas work?](/docs/ethereum-gas)
4. [What are Ethereum accounts?](/docs/ethereum-accounts)
5. [How to Read Data with JSON-RPC](/docs/how-to-read-data-with-json-rpc)
6. [How to Create a JSON REST API for Ethereum](/docs/create-json-rest-api)
7. [What are Ethereum nodes?](/docs/ethereum-nodes)
8. [How do Ethereum transactions work?](/docs/how-ethereum-transactions-work)
9. [Introduction to Ethereum Frontend Libraries](/docs/ethereum-frontend-libraries)

This series of content starts with a high level overview of Ethereum, and then explains Proof-of-Stake, which is Ethereum's consensus mechanism.

Next, the content will explain the concept of gas, which pays for the cost of completing transactions on the network. Then, we'll go in-depth on Ethereum "Accounts", which is the fancy term for wallets and smart contracts.

Lastly, we'll explain how to read data from Ethereum, creating a REST API to streamline the process, and show you all the great frontend libraries you can use to unlock the full power of Ethereum's vast and valuable data.

By the end of this section, you'll know how Ethereum works down to the bytecode level!
