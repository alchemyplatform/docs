Scaffold-Alchemy provides a collection of custom React hooks designed to simplify interactions with your deployed smart contracts. These hooks are wrappers around Wagmi, an easy-to-use interface with typescript autocompletions for reading from, writing to, and monitoring events emitted by your smart contracts.

To ensure autocompletions function correctly, always update the `targetNetworks` in `scaffold.config.ts` to include the relevant network/chain whenever you deploy your contract using `yarn deploy --network`.

<Info>
  The custom hooks rely on three main files for their functionality and TypeScript autocompletion:

  The `deployedContracts.ts` file is auto-generated/updated whenever you run `yarn deploy --network`. It organizes contract addresses and abi's based on chainId.

  When having multiple chains configured in `targetNetworks,` make sure to have same contractName's on other chains as `targetNetworks[0].id`.This ensures proper functionality and autocompletion of custom hooks, as the current setup and types assumes that same contract's are present on other chains as `targetNetworks[0]`.
