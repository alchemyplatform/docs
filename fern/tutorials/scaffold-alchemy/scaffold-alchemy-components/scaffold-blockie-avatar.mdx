Show a blockie (bar code profile icon) component for a given public address.

The autogenerated blockie can be manually replaced by another image that we pass through the `ensImage` prop.

If you want more control over styling the blockie, you can directly use [blo](https://github.com/bpierre/blo) (pre-installed in Scaffold-ETH 2) and internally used by `BlockieAvatar` component to get the image URL.
