# Installation

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

* [Node (>= v22.0)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup

For a simplified setup, Scaffold-Alchemy offers a npx tool that guides you interactively through the setup:

```shell
npx create-web3-dapp@latest
```

You will be presented with a prompt:

* **Project Name:** Enter a name for your project, e.g., my-dapp-example.

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd project-name
```

# Environment

Now that our installation is complete, let's configure the development environment for Scaffold-Alchemy.

### 1. **Setup Your Environment Variables**:

* setup account kit on dashboard
* update gas policy id
* update API key
* set your chain

### 2. **Deploy Your Smart Contract**:

In a terminal, deploy the test contract:

```shell
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the chain of your choice. The contract can be modified to suit your needs and can be found in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`

The `yarn deploy` command uses a deploy script to deploy the contract to the network. You can customize the deployment script located in: `packages/hardhat/deploy`

### 3. **Launch your NextJS Application**:

In the third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```shell
yarn start
```

Visit your app on `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the contract component or the example ui in the frontend.

## What's Next:

* Edit your smart contract:
  * `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
* Edit your deployment scripts:
  * `packages/hardhat/deploy`
* Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
* Edit the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`
* Edit your smart contract test in:
  * `packages/hardhat/test` to run test use `yarn hardhat:test`
