<Info>
  We recommend connecting your GitHub repo to Vercel (through the Vercel UI) so it gets automatically deployed when pushing to `main`.
</Info>

If you want to deploy directly from the CLI, run this and follow the steps to deploy to Vercel:

```shell
yarn vercel
```

You might need to log in to Vercel first by running:

```shell
yarn vercel:login
```

Once you log in (email, GitHub, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run:

```shell
yarn vercel --prod
```

If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

**Make sure to check the values of your Scaffold Configuration before deploying your NextJS App.**

## Scaffold App Configuration

You can configure different settings for your dapp at `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts ts
  export type ScaffoldConfig = {
    targetNetworks: Chain[];
    pollingInterval: number;
    alchemyApiKey: string;
    walletConnectProjectId: string;
    onlyLocalBurnerWallet: boolean;
    walletAutoConnect: boolean;
    // your dapp custom config, eg:
    // tokenIcon : string;
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The configuration parameters are described below. Make sure to update the values according to your needs:

#### - targetNetworks

Array of blockchain networks where your dapp is deployed. Use values that are present on chains object from [viem/chains](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction) eg: `targetNetworks: [chains.optimism]`

#### - pollingInterval

The interval in milliseconds at which your front-end application polls the RPC servers for fresh data. *Note that this setting does not affect the local network.*

#### - alchemyApiKey

Default Alchemy API key from Scaffold-Alchemy for local testing purposes. It's recommended to obtain your own API key from the [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) and store it in this environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` in the `\packages\nextjs\.env.local` file.
