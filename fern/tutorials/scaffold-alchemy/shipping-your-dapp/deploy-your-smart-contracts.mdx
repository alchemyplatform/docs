To deploy your smart contracts to a live network, there are a few things you need to adjust.

## 1. Configure your network

Scaffold-Alchemy comes with a selection of predefined networks. To add your custom network:

Go to `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts` and add your network to the `networks` object.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript title="packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts"
  networks: {
      // ... other networks
      base: {
          url: "https://mainnet.base.org",
          accounts: [deployerPrivateKey]
      },
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Here are the [Alchemy docs](/docs/how-to-add-alchemy-rpc-endpoints-to-metamask) for information on specific networks.

## 2. Generate a new account or add one to deploy the contract(s) from.

The deployer account is the account that will deploy your contracts. Additionally, the deployer account will be used to execute any function calls that are part of your deployment script.

You can generate a random account / private key by running:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell
  yarn generate
  ```
</CodeGroup>

It will automatically add the encrypted private key (`DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_ENCRYPTED`) in your `.env` file.

You will be prompted to enter a password which will be used to encrypt your private key. **Make sure to remember this password as you'll need it for future deployments and account queries.**

<Info>
  We are only storing the plain private key in memory, it's never stored in disk files for security reasons. Checkout the code [here](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth/blob/main/templates/solidity-frameworks/hardhat/packages/hardhat/scripts/generateAccount.ts).
</Info>

If you prefer to import your private key, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell
  yarn account:import
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You will get prompted to paste your private key and set the encryption password. It will store your encrypted private key in your `.env` file.

You can check the configured (generated or imported) account and balances with:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell
  yarn account
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You will need to enter your password to decrypt the private key and view the account information and balances.

## 3. Deploy your smart contract(s)

By default `yarn deploy` will deploy all the contracts from your `packages/hardhat/contracts` folder to the local network. You can change `defaultNetwork` in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`

### 3.1 Deploy specific contracts

To deploy specific contracts instead of all of them, you can follow these steps:

1. Add tags to the deploy scripts located in `packages/hardhat/deploy`. For example `01_deploy_my_contract.ts`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts ts
  deployMyContract.tags = ["tagExample"];
  ```
</CodeGroup>

2. Run `yarn deploy --tags tagExample` to run all the scripts with the "tagExample" tag.

### 3.2 Deploy to specific networks

Run the command below to deploy the smart contracts to the target network. Make sure to have your encryption password and some funds in your deployer account to pay for the transaction.

```shell
yarn deploy --network network_name
```

You can also specify a tag:

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh sh
  yarn deploy --network sepolia --tags tagExample
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 4. Verify your smart contract

You can verify your smart contract on Etherscan by running:

```shell
yarn verify --network network_name
```

eg: `yarn verify --network sepolia`

One option to verify your deployed contracts is to use [etherscan-verify from hardhat-deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy#4-hardhat-etherscan-verify)

Alternatively, you can use [hardhat-verify](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify) to verify your contracts, passing in the network name, contract address and constructor arguments (if any):

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh sh
  yarn hardhat-verify --network network_name contract_address "Constructor arg 1"`
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If the chain you're using is not supported by any of the verifying methods, you can add new supported chains to your chosen method, either [etherscan-verify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy#options-2) or [hardhat-verify](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#adding-support-for-other-networks).

## Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps.

By default, Scaffold-Alchemy provides predefined API keys. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for these services.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

* `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` and `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).
* `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` using your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

<Info>
  It's recommended to store envs for nextjs in Vercel/system env config for live apps and use .env.local for local testing.
