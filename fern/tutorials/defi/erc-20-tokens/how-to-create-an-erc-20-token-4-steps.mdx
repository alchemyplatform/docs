An Ethereum Token is an incredibly powerful feature of the Ethereum virtual machine, as it can represent virtually anything from financial assets to skills of a game character, to a fiat currency, and so much more.

## Why build your own ERC-20 token?

**The [ERC-20 token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) is the most popular way to create fungible cryptocurrencies on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains, and therefore allows builders and creators to develop digital assets for their protocol, marketplace, metaverse, or community.** This tutorial will teach you how to create your own ERC-20 token on Ethereum's Goerli testnet using [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=c4a776f6dc), MetaMask, HardHat, and Solidity code snippets. At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to deploy your own ERC-20 token smart contract. The estimated time to complete this guide is 15 minutes.

## What is the ERC-20 token standard?

**The ERC-20 token standard ensures that all tokens have the same properties, including that all tokens are fungible (any one token is exactly equal to any other token), and no tokens have special properties or rights associated with them.**

This means that for a token to follow the ERC-20 token standard, it must implement the following API methods and events:

* `totalSupply` - a method that defines the total supply of your tokens, and stops creating new tokens when the `totalSupply` limit is reached.
* `balanceOf` - a method that returns the number of tokens a wallet address contains.
* `transfer` - a method that transfers in a certain amount of tokens from the total supply and sends it to a user.
* `transferFrom` - a transfer method that transfers ERC-20 tokens between users
* `approve` - verifies whether a smart contract is allowed to allocate a certain amount of tokens to a user, considering the total supply.
* `allowance` - checks if a user has enough balance to send a token to another user.

*ERC-20 tokens are fungible (can be interchanged) because they have the same value and properties. There are also non-fungible token standards and semi-fungible token standards such as [ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/comparing-erc-721-to-erc-1155).*

# How to Create an ERC-20 Token

In four steps you'll create and deploy an ERC-20 token on the Goerli test network, using Metamask, Solidity, Hardhat, and [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=c4a776f6dc). This Goerli ERC-20 token will have all the characteristics required above, making it a valid ERC-20 token.

<Warning>
  We recommend using [Sepolia](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/sepolia-testnet) testnet as Alchemy has full Sepolia support and a free [Sepolia faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) as well.
</Warning>

## 1. Set Up your Developer Environment

First, create an Alchemy account, and set up Metamask, HardHat, and Solidity for this project. For a walkthrough, read through the ChainShot HardHat guide.

Next, enter `mk my-token` and `cd my-token` to create a folder for your project and change directories to your my-token folder, then run `npm init`

If you don't already have NPM installed, use this [guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  mk my-token
  cd my-token
  npm init
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next, go to the `my-token` project root directory and type `mkdir contracts` and `mkdir scripts` into your command line to create two new folders that will organize your ERC-20 smart contracts and your deployment scripts:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  mkdir contracts
  mkdir scripts
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Write ERC-20 Token Smart Contract

Here's how to write the token contract for your ERC-20 token using Solidity, which is like Java and JavaScript, or C and C++:

1. Open up the `my-token`
