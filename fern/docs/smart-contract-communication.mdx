**Previous Section Recap**

In the previous section, we looked at functions and their various forms of visibility, which dictates who can actually call into a function:

* **public** = anyone can call this function
  * **external** = anyone, outside of this contract, can call this function
    * **internal** = only this contract and its inheritance chain can call this function
      * **private** = only this contract can call this function

We also looked at how "getter" function can be declared as either `view` or `pure`:

* **view** = declares that no state will be changed
  * **pure** = declares that no state variable will be changed *or* read

## Smart Contract Compilation

Up until now, we've learned about the Solidity programming language and how it used to write programs on the [Ethereum computer](/docs/what-is-ethereum), otherwise referred to as **smart contracts**.

Let's get a little lower-level... In order to understand how contracts communicate, we must first understand:

1. contract **compilation**
2. contract **deployment**
3. contract **interaction**

### Contract Compilation Produces Two Artifacts: ABI & Bytecode

When a smart contract is compiled, the Solidity compilation process produces two *very important artifacts*:

![sc-compilation](/images/divzjiip8/image/upload/v1671068770/alchemyu/Screen_Shot_2022-12-14_at_5.27.18_PM_5b9ff7.png)

1. [the contract's **ABI**](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html):
   * we *keep* the ABI for front-end libraries to be able to communicate with the contract
2. the contract's **bytecode**
   * we *deploy* the bytecode directly to the blockchain, in which case it is stored directly in the contract account's state trie

### ABI - Application Binary Interface (Computer Science)

In computer science, an ABI is typically an interface between two program modules. For example, an operating system must communicate with a user program somehow. That communication is bridged by an **ABI**, an **Application Binary Interface**.

An ABI defines how data structures and functions are accessed in the machine code. Thus, this is the primary way of encoding/decoding data in and out of machine code.

You can think of an ABI as a general encoding/decoding bridge for machine code. ðŸ¤–

### ABI - Application Binary Interface (Ethereum)

**In Ethereum, a contract's ABI is [the standard way to interact with a contract](/docs/smart-contract-abi).**

The ABI is needed to communicate with smart contracts, whether you are:

* attempting to interact with a contract from outside the blockchain (ie. interacting with a smart contract via a dApp)
* attempting a contract-to-contract interaction (ie. a contract performing a JUMP call to another contract), t

The ABI is used to encode contract calls for the EVM and to read data out of transactions.

In Ethereum, the purpose of the ABI is to:

1. **define the functions in the contract that can be invoked** and...
2. **describe how each function will accept arguments and return its result**

### What Does the ABI Look Like? ðŸ¤”

Let's look at a quick Solidity smart contract:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  // SPDX-Licence-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity 0.8.4;

  contract Counter {
      uint public count;

      // Function to get the current count
      function get() public view returns (uint) {
          return count;
      }

      // Function to increment count by 1
      function inc() public {
          count += 1;
      }

      // Function to decrement count by 1
      function dec() public {
          // This function will fail if count = 0
          count -= 1;
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

`Counter.sol` is a simple smart contract that presides over one single state variable: `count`. There are a few function that directly control the `count` state and anyone can call them. That's all fine as well, but what if we want to cool a function from this contract from a front-end library like Ethers.js? This is where you'll need the ABI!

This is what the `Counter.sol` ABI looks like:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  [
          {
                  "inputs": [],
                  "name": "count",
                  "outputs": [
                          {
                                  "internalType": "uint256",
                                  "name": "",
                                  "type": "uint256"
                          }
                  ],
                  "stateMutability": "view",
                  "type": "function"
          },
          {
                  "inputs": [],
                  "name": "dec",
                  "outputs": [],
                  "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
                  "type": "function"
          },
          {
                  "inputs": [],
                  "name": "get",
                  "outputs": [
                          {
                                  "internalType": "uint256",
                                  "name": "",
                                  "type": "uint256"
                          }
                  ],
                  "stateMutability": "view",
                  "type": "function"
          },
          {
                  "inputs": [],
                  "name": "inc",
                  "outputs": [],
                  "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
                  "type": "function"
          }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

As you can see, the ABI of a contract is just one big JSON object. As developers, we simply need to know that the ABI is necessary in order for front-end tools to be able to interface and thus communicate with a smart contract! ðŸ’»ðŸ—£ðŸ“œ This is further explained in the **ABI Encoding** section below.

  If you aren't familiar with the term "calldata", make sure to review the last section of [Intro to Transactions](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum/md/intro-to-ethereum-transactions). ðŸ§

### ABI vs API

Similar to an API, the ABI is a human-readable representation of a code's interface. An ABI defines the methods and structures used to interact with the machine code representation of a contract, just like APIs do for higher-level composability.

### ABI Encoding

The ABI indicates to the caller of a contract function *how* to encode the needed information, such as function signatures and variable declarations, in such a way that the EVM knows how to communicate that call to the deployed contract's bytecode.

### Interacting With a Smart Contract

If your web application wants to interact with a smart contract on Ethereum, it needs:

1. the contract's **address**
2. the contract's **ABI**

We provide the ABI to the front-end library. The front-end library then translates and delivers any requests we make using that ABI.

Let's look at an example...

#### Ethers.js Contract Instance Example

[`Contract` is a class abstraction in ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract/) that allows us to create programmatic instances of contracts in a flash.

Here is a quick script that can be used to interact with the `Counter.sol` contract we inspected above, [now deployed on GÃ¶erli test network](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x5F91eCd82b662D645b15Fd7D2e20E5e5701CCB7A):

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  require('dotenv').config();
  const ethers = require('ethers');

  const contractABI = [
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: 'count',
      outputs: [{ internalType: 'uint256', name: '', type: 'uint256' }],
      stateMutability: 'view',
      type: 'function',
    },
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: 'dec',
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
      type: 'function',
    },
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: 'get',
      outputs: [{ internalType: 'uint256', name: '', type: 'uint256' }],
      stateMutability: 'view',
      type: 'function',
    },
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: 'inc',
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
      type: 'function',
    },
  ];

  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider(
    'goerli',
    process.env.TESTNET_ALCHEMY_KEY
  );

  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  async function main() {
    const counterContract = new ethers.Contract(
      '0x5F91eCd82b662D645b15Fd7D2e20E5e5701CCB7A',
      contractABI,
      wallet
    );

    await counterContract.inc();
  }

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Here is a full video of the process, if you want to code along with us!

## Bytecode

We've covered the main artifact produced via contract compilation: the contract's ABI. Now let's look at what is produced at contract deployment: the contract's bytecode. Contract bytecode is the translation of that smart contract that [machines can understand](/docs/how-does-solidity-work), specifically the EVM. It represents the actual program, in machine code, on the Ethereum computer.

There are two types of bytecode:

1. **Creation time bytecode** - is executed only once at deployment, contains the `constructor`
2. **Run time bytecode** - is stored on the blockchain as permanent executable

## Transaction Receipt

![tx-translation](/images/divzjiip8/image/upload/v1671079099/alchemyu/Screen_Shot_2022-12-14_at_8.37.41_PM.png)

As in the script above, we provide the ABI to ethers. Once ethers has the contract's ABI, we can make a call to the [`Counter`](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x5F91eCd82b662D645b15Fd7D2e20E5e5701CCB7A#code) smart contract's `inc()` function. Like the image above shows, the front-end library then translates and delivers any requests using the ABI. Once the transaction is successfully sent and validated on the Ethereum network, a **receipt** is generated containing logs and any gas used.

### Receipts Trie

Anytime a transaction occurs on the Ethereum network, the receipt is stored in the [receipt trie of that block](/docs/patricia-merkle-tries). The trie contains four pieces of information:

* Post-Transaction State
* Cumulative Gas Used
* Set of Logs Created During Execution (ie. did any **events** fire?)
* Bloom Filter Composed from the Logs

## Conclusion

![conclusion](/images/divzjiip8/image/upload/v1671078706/alchemyu/Screen_Shot_2022-12-14_at_8.31.19_PM.png)

As you can see in the diagram above, if you want to interact with the Ethereum computer in one of a few ways, you must have some important artifacts with you.

If you are writing contracts TO Ethereum (ie. deploying), the contract compilation produces what you need: the contract's bytecode.

If you are reading contracts FROM Ethereum, the contract compilation produces what you need here as well: the contract's ABI.
