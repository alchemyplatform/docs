The SDK Developer Challenge is an opportunity to build and learn together, using daily guides to inspire and motivate you to supercharge your app with the SDK.

The SDK will be your secret weapon to help simplify your code so you can build faster.

As you build, [submit your project](https://alchemyapi.typeform.com/to/De3bpy01) to win prizes.

What could you win? Epic never-before seen Alchemy swag, and $500 in monthly Alchemy credit.

For all of the challenges, you will need to set up a [free Alchemy account](https://auth.alchemy.com/signup?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.alchemy.com%2Fsignup%2F%3Freferrer_origin%3DDIRECT). This will give you access to the SDK, as well as a HUGE selection of web3 development tools.

Ok, let's go!
