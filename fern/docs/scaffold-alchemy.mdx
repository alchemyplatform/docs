[scaffold-alchemy](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/scaffold-alchemy) is a fork of the popular starter project [scaffold-eth 2](https://scaffoldeth.io/). It is everything you need to build dApps on Ethereum. You can get started immediately NextJS, TypeScript, Hardhat, [AccountKit](https://accountkit.alchemy.com/), [Enhanced APIs](/reference/enhanced-apis-overview) and [Subgraphs](/docs/alchemy-subgraphs-overview) ðŸ¤©

The beauty of Scaffold Alchemy is that you can have lightning fast iteration between your smart contracts and web application code. Make changes to your contracts and immediately you'll have hooks, components and types that recognize these changes.

# What are the core features? 

With Scaffold Alchemy you'll immediately get access to the best in class alchemy product suite:

**Account Kit**: Everything you need to build zero-friction user flows, from sign-up to checkout, in minutes.

**Enhanced APIs**: Make use of enhanced APIs for common use cases like [NFTs](/reference/nft-api-quickstart) and [Tokens](/reference/token-api-quickstart). With enhanced APIs you can access data that would be otherwise require processing blocks and building up your own database.

**Subgraphs**: When you have data on the blockchain that is otherwise difficult to aggregate, you can make use of subgraphs to read this information in an efficient way.

In addition you'll have access to the features that have made Scaffold ETH such a popular tool:

**Debug Contracts**: An auto-reloading UI for working directly with your smart contracts through Account Kit.

**Components**: Built-in UI elements that are easily reusable as you build up your application.

**Hooks**: Hooks which make it easy to read and write blockchain data, automatically tied to your smart contracts as you build and deploy them.
