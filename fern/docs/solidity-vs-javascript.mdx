Before we dive into Solidity Coding Tutorials, let's study a Smart Contract! üî¨

Here is an example smart contract called **OnOffSwitch** written in [Solidity](/docs/how-does-solidity-work):

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  /* Here we specify the solidity versions
   * Any version greater than or equal to 0.6.2
   * or less than 0.7.0 will compile this contract */
  pragma solidity ^0.6.2;

  contract OnOffSwitch {
      // the switch is on if true
      bool private isOn;

      constructor() public {
          // we'll default to being on
          isOn = true;
      }

      // a publicly accessible function to "flip" the switch
      function toggle() public returns(bool) {
          // flip isOn from true->false or false->true
          isOn = !isOn;
          // return the new value
          return isOn;
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Coming from learning JavaScript, what are some of the **immediately noticeable** things about this programming language?

First, let's look at the familiar! **Things that are similar to JavaScript**:

* Comments appear to be the same! Both syntaxes: `// comment` and `/* comment */`
* The casing used is the same as JavaScript, it is lowerCamelCase
* Curly Braces `{}` seem to serve a similar purpose, **marking scope**
* Boolean values `true`/`false` which can be modified with boolean operators: `!`
* The `contract` keyword seems a bit like JavaScript `class`, especially the constructor
* The function syntax looks a bit similar to JavaScript
* The `return` keyword is still used for passing a value back from a function

Now let's look at the **dissimilarities**:

* There seems to be some kind of version control statement at the top: `pragma`
* There are **public**/**private** keywords for variables and functions
* The `isOn` variable is prefaced with its type `bool`
* The code refers to the `isOn` member variable without using `this`
* The function `toggle` defines what it will return, a `bool`

Ok, well that was a good quick glance! üëÅ

Now let's dive into all of these things we noticed to learn more about the language. üßê

## Compiler Version Control ‚öôÔ∏è

Version Control can be very helpful to specify a range of versions that are acceptable for a dependency or a tool.

In Solidity, we can specify what versions of the compiler our contract will work with using the `pragma` keyword:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.6.2;
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The `^` symbol indicates that this contract will compile with not only version `0.6.2`, but also anything above that version all the way up until the next minor version `0.7.0`.

This syntax may look very similar to you from **npm** when we worked with the **package.json**! Both of these systems use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) where there are three values:

* The **major** version: `x.0.0`
* The **minor** version: `0.x.0`
* The **patch** version: `0.0.x`

**Major** updates make no guarantee of backwards compatibility. Generally, major updates introduce **many breaking changes** that will require you to make changes to your code to update successfully.

**Minor** version updates will generally add functionality in a backwards-compatible way.

**Patch** version updates are meant for bug fixes and **should not** break your code's expected behavior (unless you were depending on behavior which was the result of a bug).

<Info>
  It should be noted that, at the time of writing, **Solidity has yet to release its first major version**. Prior to the **major version 1.0.0**, many systems are considered *unstable* where *anything* may change at any time. So far Solidity development has stuck to making breaking changes on the **minor** version updates. That is, for example, contracts written for `0.4.x` may not work with solidity compiler versions `0.5.x` and above. Each release will [document the breaking changes](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/050-breaking-changes.html).
</Info>

## The Contract üìú

At first glance, the `contract` keyword looks a bit like `class` in JavaScript!

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  contract OnOffSwitch {
      // the switch is on if true
      bool private isOn;

      constructor() public {
          // we'll default to being on
          isOn = true;
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

üëÜüèº Here we are declaring `isOn` as a member variable of the `OnOffSwitch` contract. In Solidity these variables are generally referred to as **state variables**.

Just like in JavaScript classes, the constructor is run **only once**. For contracts, the constructor is run **when it is deployed**. The `isOn` state variable will be set to `true` on the deployment of this contract.

The `isOn` variable is accessible anywhere in this contract by name. Unlike JavaScript class variables, there is no need to use `this.` inside of the contract itself to gain access to the state variables.

<Info>
  The `this` keyword is still used in Solidity as a reference to the **contract account**. We'll talk about this a bit more in the upcoming coding tutorials!
</Info>

Since state variables are referred to by name, you may often see constructor arguments using underscores to disambiguate:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  constructor(bool _isOn) public {
      // in this case we'll accept a boolean argument
      // that will set the initial value of isOn
      isOn = _isOn;
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

It's important to recognize that when we make a change to a state variable on a deployed smart contract, we are **modifying permanent storage** on the blockchain.

<Info>
  Remember from our lessons on Ethereum that permanent storage on the blockchain is stored in Patricia Merkle Tries on every Ethereum Full Node. üå≤ üíª
</Info>

Local variables defined inside of a code block `{}` or passed in as arguments live in memory only for the length of their particular scope.

## Control Structures üéõ

As you may have noticed in our initial example, Solidity also has the `return` statement for passing back values from a function.

One difference in Solidity is that multiple values can be returned from a Solidity function as a **tuple**:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  function getValues() public pure returns (int, bool) {
      return (49, true);
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The following statement is perfectly valid in Solidity. Similarly, tuples can be used to **destructure** assignments similar to destructuring in JavaScript:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  (bool x, bool y) = (true, false);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  You can think of a **tuple** simply as a group of values in parenthesis. They are not a formal structure in Solidity so they are primarily used for returning and destructuring as shown above.
</Info>

Along with the `return` keyword, Solidity also has `if`, `else`, `while`, `do`, `for`, `break`, and `continue` with the same semantics as JavaScript.

## Visibility üëÄ

You may have noticed the keywords `public` and `private` in the initial contract example shown. These keywords are called **visibility specifiers** because they determine from where functions can be accessed.

As you might expect, a `public` function is one that can be accessed from anywhere. A `private` function is one that cannot be. When a variable is declared `public`, a **getter** function is generated that will allow access to the variable state.

<Warning>
  The keyword private does not **protect the privacy of the data itself**. Any data committed to the [Ethereum blockchain is public](/docs/what-are-blockchain-networks) for anyone to see! Marking it as **private** will simply disallow any other contract from reading or modifying the information. üîê
</Warning>

In addition to `public` and `private`, there are also `internal` and `external` visibility specifiers. We'll discuss these specifiers further as we dive into contract communication through message passing.

## Static Typing üõ°

The last big distinction we noticed from the example is that Solidity has **static typing**.

In JavaScript, you don't need to specify the data type. We use keywords like `var`, `let` and `const` that could hold numbers, strings, and other various objects:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  let strangeValue = 3;

  strangeValue = "now im a string!";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

üëÜüèº Changing a variable's type like this may not be the best practice, however from the JavaScript language's perspective, this is perfectly valid! This is because JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**.

In Solidity, all variables must declare their type:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  bool isOn = true;
  ```
</CodeGroup>

üëÜüèº Here our `isOn` variable is a boolean value. It must always be `true` or `false`.

<Info>
  By default, boolean values are `false`.
</Info>

What if we tried storing a number in a `bool`? ü§î

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  bool myNumber = 10; // ...hmm?
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**No good!**. In fact, Solidity won't even **compile** with a statement like this. ‚ùå

The compiler will raise a **"TypeError: Type int\_const 10 is not implicitly convertible to expected type bool."** And rightly so! ü§®

<Info>
  An exception raised at compile time is called a **compile-time exception**. This means that the compiler was unable to generate bytecode from the program, so we would not even be able to deploy this contract! This is opposed to a **run-time exception** which would happen when someone tried to interact with a contract on the blockchain in some expected way.

  The exception would occur when a miner tries to validate the transaction. Unless the exception is caught, the transaction will fail and the miner will consume all the gas. ‚õΩÔ∏è
</Info>

Static typing also affects the way the function is declared. Let's use our example above where we returned a **tuple**:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity solidity
  function getValues() public pure returns (int, bool) {
      return (49, true);
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

üëÜüèº Here the function must declare what type of values it is going to return. It defines that an integer and boolean will be returned in a tuple list **in that order**.

If it were to try and return values of a different data type it would throw an exception.
