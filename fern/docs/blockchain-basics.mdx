Blockchains may seem like an overwhelming subject, but learning the basics is not as bad as you think. Understanding Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two most important blockchains, will provide the necessary background to start your web3 education.

This guide will teach you about the origins of blockchain technology starting with an understanding of Bitcoin: the breakthrough blockchain-based digital currency created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto.

**We'll cover:**

1. [What is a blockchain?](/docs/what-is-a-blockchain)
2. [What is Proof-of-Work?](/docs/proof-of-work)
3. [Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms](/docs/what-are-blockchain-consensus-mechanisms)
4. [What are blockchain networks?](/docs/what-are-blockchain-networks)
5. [What is a 51% attack?](/docs/51-percent-attack)
6. [The History of Bitcoin](/docs/bitcoin-genesis-block)
7. [UTXO vs. Account Models](/docs/utxo-vs-account-model)

After you learn about blockchain basics, you can learn about more advanced modules like cryptography, Ethereum, Solidity, and smart contracts!
