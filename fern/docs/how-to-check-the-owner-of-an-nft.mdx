One of the most fundamental aspects of an NFT is ownership.

Whether you're [building an NFT marketplace](/docs/7-how-to-build-an-nft-marketplace-from-scratch) like OpenSea, a [web3 wallet](https://www.alchemy.com/web3-wallets-overview) like Rainbow, or an analytics platform like rarity.tools, knowing who owns an NFT is important information.

An NFT can have [a single owner (ERC-721) or multiple owners (ERC-1155)](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/comparing-erc-721-to-erc-1155).

Typically, getting ownership data on an NFT requires you to:

1. spin up a node
2. call functions on the NFT contract
3. parse the output

Now, getting a list of owners for an NFT collection takes one API call using [Alchemy's NFT API](/reference/nft-api).


In this tutorial, we will write a script in Node.js that tells us who the owner of an NFT is using the NFT API. In this example, we will use an NFT called **Safe Haven** from the **TIMEPieces** collection.

## Step 0: Configure your developer environment

Before you begin, complete the following steps to [set up your web3 developer environment](/docs/how-to-set-up-core-web3-developer-tools).

1\. Install [Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/)(> 14) on your local machine

2\. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your local machine

To check your Node version, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node -v
  ```
</CodeGroup>

3\. [Create a free Alchemy account](https://alchemy.com/?a=d3d4c6ebf1)

## Step 1: Create a new Alchemy app

To create an Alchemy app, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfggWxfG9o0) or follow the instructions below:

1. From [Alchemy's dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/), hover over the **Apps** drop-down menu and choose **Create App**.
2. Provide a **Name** and **Description** for your app.
3. For **Chain**, select **Ethereum** and for **Network** select **Goerli**.
4. Click the **Create App** button.

<div align="center" style="color: gray; font-style: italic;">Creating an app on the Alchemy Dashboard</div>     

Once you have created your app, get your API key that we will use later in this tutorial.

1. Click on your app's **View Key** button in the dashboard
2. Copy and save the **API KEY**

## Step 2: Create a Node project

Let's create an empty repository and install all node dependencies.

To make requests to the NFT API, we recommend using the [Alchemy SDK Quickstart](/reference/alchemy-sdk-quickstart).

However, you can also use the `axios` or `fetch` libraries. We provide code samples for each

From your terminal, run the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Alchemy SDK (Recommended)
  mkdir nft-owner && cd nft-owner
  npm init -y
  npm install --save alchemy-sdk
  touch main.js
  ```

  ```shell Axios
  mkdir nft-owner && cd nft-owner
  npm init -y
  npm install --save axios
  touch main.js
  ```

  ```shell Fetch
  mkdir nft-owner && cd nft-owner
  npm init -y
  touch main.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will create a repository named `nft-owner` that holds all the files and dependencies we need.

Open this repo in your preferred code editor, where we'll write our code in the `main.js` file.

## Step 3: Find the owner of an NFT

To get the owner of a single NFT, use the [getOwnersForToken](/reference/getownersfortoken) function.

**This function accepts two required arguments.**

1. `contractAddress`: The NFT's smart contract address (ERC-721 or ERC-1155)
2. `tokenId`: The ID of the NFT (decimal or hexadecimal format)

We require these two arguments because any NFT on any blockchain can be uniquely identified only by specifying both its contract address and token ID.

For more information, check out the [NFT API QuickStart](/reference/nft-api-quickstart).

Next, add the following code to the `main.js` file, using your Alchemy API key:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Alchemy SDK (Recommended) 
  // Setup: npm install alchemy-sdk
  import { Alchemy, Network } from "alchemy-sdk";

  const config = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->",
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,
  };
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
    // TIMEPieces contract address
    const address = "0xDd69da9a83ceDc730bc4d3C56E96D29Acc05eCDE";

    // Safe Haven Token ID
    const tokenId = 4254;

    // Get owner of NFT
    const owner = await alchemy.nft.getOwnersForNft(address, tokenId);
    console.log(owner);
  };

  const runMain = async () => {
    try {
      await main();
      process.exit(0);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
      process.exit(1);
    }
  };

  runMain();
  ```

  ```javascript Axios
  const axios = require('axios')

  // TIMEPieces contract address
  const address =
      '0xDd69da9a83ceDc730bc4d3C56E96D29Acc05eCDE'

  // Safe Haven Token ID
  const tokenId = 4254

  // Alchemy API key
  const apiKey = '<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->';

  // Alchemy URL
  const baseURL = `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/nft/v2/${apiKey}/getOwnersForToken`;
  const url = `${baseURL}?contractAddress=${address}&tokenId=${tokenId}`;

  const config = {
      method: 'get',
      url: url,
  };

  axios(config)
      .then(response => console.log(response.data))
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  ```

  ```javascript Fetch
  import fetch from 'node-fetch';

  // TIMEPieces contract address
  const address =
      '0xDd69da9a83ceDc730bc4d3C56E96D29Acc05eCDE'

  // Safe Haven Token ID
  const tokenId = 4254

  // Alchemy API key
  const apiKey = '<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->';

  // Alchemy URL
  const baseURL = `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/nft/v2/${apiKey}/getOwnersForToken`;
  const url = `${baseURL}?contractAddress=${address}&tokenId=${tokenId}`;

  var requestOptions = {
    method: 'get',
    redirect: 'follow'
  };

  fetch(url, requestOptions)
    .then(response => console.log)
    .catch(error => console.log('error', error))
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Run this script by running the following command in your terminal:

`node main.js`

If successful, you should see output that looks something like this:

`{ owners: [ '0xc9391d1ea5d092f774cf66312a9a347aaedf95a5' ] }`

Since the NFT we were interested in was of the ERC-721 standard, we retrieved an array with only a single wallet address as the owner.

If we were retrieving information for an ERC-1155 NFT, which can have multiple owners, the array might contain multiple wallet addresses.
