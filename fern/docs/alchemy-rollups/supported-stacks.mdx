# Arbitrum Orbit

Arbitrum Orbit is is an open-source rollup implementation built by the Arbitrum team. Their technology boasts the usual benefits of rollups, like dedicated compute for your application, in addition to:

- **10-100x cheaper fees** than Ethereum Mainnet (go even cheaper with [data availability committee support](https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust))
- **Interoperability** with Mainnet through trustless bridging and fraud proofs
- **Close** **Ethereum Compatibility**, so you can use the same workflows and tooling
- [**Stylus**](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/hello-stylus-6b18fecc3a22), which will allow you to write smart contracts in a more performant VM with Rust, C++, or other languages that can compile to WASM. These contracts can interoperate synchronously with the EVM.

# OP Stack

OP Stack is an open-source rollup implementation built by the Optimism team. In their [Bedrock Explainer](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/explainer/) (the latest version of OP Stack) Optimism outlines the benefits of their modular stack. You get:

- **10-100x cheaper fees** than Ethereum Mainnet
- **Interoperability** with Mainnet through trustless bridging
- **Ethereum Equivalence**, so you can use the same workflows and tooling
- Improved node performance, so you can get **thousands of transactions per second**
