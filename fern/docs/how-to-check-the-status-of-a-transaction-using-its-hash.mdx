### Donâ€™t have an API key?

Start using this API in your app today.

  This tutorial uses the **[getTransactionReceipt](/reference/sdk-gettransactionreceipt)** endpoint.

The transaction hash is a unique identifier that is assigned to every transaction on the blockchain network. In this article, we will explain how you can use Alchemy's [getTransactionReceipt](/reference/sdk-gettransactionreceipt) API to check the status of a transaction using its transaction hash.

# Creating the Status Checker Script

***

## Step 1: Install Node and npm

In case you haven't already, [install node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local machine.

Make sure that node is at least **v14 or higher** by typing the following in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node -v
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Create an Alchemy app

***

In case you haven't already, [sign up for a free Alchemy account](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=tx-status).

Alchemy's account dashboard where developers can create a new app on the Ethereum blockchain.

Next, navigate to the [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=tx-status) and create a new app.

Make sure you set the chain to Ethereum and the network to Mainnet. Once the app is created, click on your app's *View Key* button on the dashboard.

Take note of the **HTTP URL**.

The URL will be in this form: `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/xxxxxxxxx`

You will need this later.

## Step 3: Create a node project

Let's now create an empty repository and install all node dependencies.

Run the following commands in order to create your node project and install Alchemy SDK.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Alchemy SDK
  mkdir transaction-status-checker && cd transaction-status-checker
  npm init -y
  npm install --save alchemy-sdk
  touch main.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will create a repository named `transaction-status-checker` that holds all your files and dependencies.

Next, open this repo in your favorite code editor.

We will write all our code in the `main.js` file.

## Step 4: Check the Transaction Status

To check the status of the transaction using its transaction hash, we will use the [getTransactionReceipt](/reference/sdk-gettransactionreceipt) method.

* This method accepts a transaction hash and returns the transaction receipt, which is an object that contains the details about the transaction. The returned object has a property called `status`.
* If the value of the `status` property is `1`, it means that the transaction was successful, on the other hand, a value of `0` signifies that the transaction failed.
* If no object (transaction receipt) is returned from the `getTransactionReceipt` method, it means either the transaction is pending or the hash provided is an invalid/unknown transaction hash.

Add the following code to the `main.js` file:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript main.js
  // importing the Alchemy SDK
  const { Network, Alchemy } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Optional config object, but defaults to demo api-key and eth-mainnet.
  const settings = {
    apiKey: "demo", // Replace with your Alchemy API Key.
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network.
  };
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

  // Transaction hash for the transaction whose status we want to check
  const txHash =
    "0xd488331be3a2f9cdd0f2b351f2b13f5151630aaafd2c2b246f7f3cd7fd0b1dfc";

  // Getting the status of the transaction using getTransactionReceipt and logging accordingly
  alchemy.core.getTransactionReceipt(txHash).then((tx) => {
    if (!tx) {
      console.log("Pending or Unknown Transaction");
    } else if (tx.status === 1) {
      console.log("Transaction was successful!");
    } else {
      console.log("Transaction failed!");
    }
  });

  // Status is 1 for success, 0 for failure.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Here's an explanation of what the code is doing:

* Imports the Alchemy SDK package because we want to use Alchemy's `getTransactionReceipt` method.
* Configures the Alchemy SDK with the `API Key` and sets the network to `ETH_MAINNET`.
* Defines the transaction hash for the transaction whose status we want to check.
* Calls the `getTransactionReceipt` method of the Alchemy SDK, passing in the transaction hash as an argument.
* This returns the transaction receipt for the transaction, which contains the status of the transaction.
* It then, logs the status of the transaction to the console according to the value of the `status` property. If the `tx` object returned by getTransactionReceipt is `null`, it means that the transaction is either pending or unknown. If the value of the `status` property is `1`, it means that the transaction was successful. Otherwise, the transaction failed.

Run the script using:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node main.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If all goes well, you should see an output with the status of the transaction:

```
Transaction was successful!
```

# Conclusion

In conclusion, checking the status of a transaction using its hash is a simple process. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily track the status of your transaction.
