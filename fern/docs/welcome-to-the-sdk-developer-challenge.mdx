The SDK Developer Challenge is a challenge to build and learn together, using daily guides to inspire and motivate you to supercharge your app with the SDK.

We are very excited about this challenge! Why? Because Alchemy's SDK and Enhanced APIs are your secret weapons to simplify your code so you can build faster.

Starting February 15th, we will begin releasing daily guides to show you how you can start building with the SDK. As you code, let us know what you're building, to win two epic prizes:

1. Awesome, never-before seen Alchemy swag
2. $500 in monthly Alchemy credit

**[Submit your projects here](https://alchemyapi.typeform.com/to/De3bpy01)!**

We will begin reviewing submissions on March 7th, and will award prizes to the best submissions.

# FAQS

## How can I submit my SDK Developer Challenge project?

Submit your project [here](https://alchemyapi.typeform.com/to/De3bpy01)!

## How do I participate in the SDK Developer Challenge?

Sign up for an Alchemy account and start using the SDK to build. The guides are meant to serve as inspiration and motivation - you do not need to have built something from these guides to win.

## Do I have to build with the SDK and Enhanced APIs to win?

Yes, you do have to build with the Alchemy SDK to win. You do not have to build with the Enhanced APIs to win, but you'll probably have a better chance. Because the guides will use the Enhanced APIs, including the [SDK NFT Methods](/reference/sdk-getnfts), [SDK Transact Methods](/reference/sdk-gettransaction), [SDK Notify Methods](/reference/sdk-get-all-webhooks) or [SDK Websocket Methods](/reference/sdk-websockets-endpoints), integrating them into your project should be especially easy.

## What type of projects are you looking for?

We're looking for projects that inspire you and enrich your app. Whether you're fetching NFT activity or token balances, filtering spam from your app or sending transaction simulations, or any other feature you want to build, we'll be pumped.

## What information will I need to submit to win?

You will need to submit basic contact info (email, Twitter handle), as well as an Alchemy API key, project description, details on the endpoints you're calling and a repo of your project.

## Where can I find my API Key?

As soon as you create an App on the homepage of the developer dashboard, there is an option to "View Key". Click that and copy and paste your API Key into the submission form.

## I'm confused about this initiative. Can you help?

Of course! Please email [\[emailÂ protected\]\_](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#69361a0d020b1c00050d0c1b1a1c1919061b1d2908050a010c0410470a060436) and we'll get back to you.
