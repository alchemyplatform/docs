## What are Multi-Chain Token APIs?

Multi-Chain Token APIs allow you to query token data across multiple chains. For example, [Token Balances By Wallet](ref:alchemy-gettokenbalances) allows you to fetch token balances across Solana, Ethereum, Base, and other EVM chains in a single API call.

- ðŸš€ Speeds up your user experience: get all of the information you need in a single call vs. chaining together multiple parallel calls across networks.
- ðŸ§˜ Future proof: no need to add additional API calls when expanding what chains you need, just change the parameters you send in. 

<br />

## What's the difference between Tokens by Wallet and Token Balances by Wallet?

We are planning to have two basic types of endpoints:

- Specific & Powerful Endpoints
- Unified & Generalized APIs

<br />

For example - if you _only_ need balances, you should use the more powerful and specific Token Balances by Wallet API, since it can return more balances across more chains. But if you need more flexibility and other fields passed through, use the Tokens by Wallet API which gives you flexibility in what metadata and price information you want returned.

By offering both well-scoped and generalized APIs, we ensures you have the right tool for the right job.
