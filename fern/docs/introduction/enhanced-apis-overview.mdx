Access the blockchain like never before with Alchemy's continually expanding [Enhanced API suite](https://www.alchemy.com/enhanced-apis), and web3 developer tools! Query NFTs by the user, trace transactions, get real-time notifications in your dApp, debug smart contracts faster, and do more with Alchemy's supported endpoints.

## [NFT API](ref:nft-api-quickstart)

Alchemy's [NFT API](ref:nft-api) allows you to quickly get all the information you need to know about NFTs from the blockchain including Ethereum and Polygon.

Rather than searching, indexing, and storing data yourself - you can now make one request to fetch specific NFT information for both [ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/comparing-erc-721-to-erc-1155), like:

- All NFTs owned by an address
- Metadata and attributes for a specific NFT token

## [Transfers API Endpoints](ref:transfers-api-endpoints)

Transfers are a representation of value being exchanged between two accounts, and sometimes users wish to see the historical transactions associated with a specific account or address.

Getting historical transactions is currently an extremely challenging and inefficient task, requiring users to scan the entire blockchain and index everything to search for transactions associated with the desired address.

With the Transfers API, users can query all historical transactions for an address in one request!

## [Transaction Receipts API](ref:transaction-receipts-quickstart)

Fetch all transaction receipts for a **block number** or a **block hash** in one API call using the [alchemy_getTransactionReceipts](ref:alchemy-gettransactionreceipts) method - for mainnet and testnets on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.

The Transaction Receipts API [uses less Compute Units (CUs)](ref:compute-units) then batching all the [eth_getTransactionReceipt](ref:eth-gettransactionreceipt) calls for each transaction hash - saving you on compute cost.

## [Token API](ref:token-api-quickstart)

Easily request information on specific tokens such as **metadata** or **balances**.

Alchemy currently supports the following endpoints:

- [alchemy_getTokenAllowance](ref:alchemy-gettokenallowance) - returns the amount the spender is allowed to withdraw from the owner.
- [alchemy_getTokenBalances](ref:alchemy-gettokenbalances) - returns token balances for a specific address given a list of contracts.
- [alchemy_getTokenMetadata](ref:alchemy-gettokenmetadata) - returns metadata (name, symbol, decimals, logo) for a given token contract address.

## [Notify API](ref:notify-api-quickstart)

Alchemy provides a set of webhooks for tracking address activity, mined transactions, dropped transactions, and gas prices on several blockchains.

Developers can manually create webhooks from within the dashboard, or programmatically create webhooks to track activity for 10+ addresses using the Notify API.

## [Trace API Endpoints](ref:trace-api)

Trace API methods give developers access to the most detailed information about on-chain activity, and allow users to get a full _externality_ trace on any transaction executed on Ethereum.

Unlike the log filtering API, you are able to search and filter based only upon address information.

Information returned includes the execution of all `CREATE,` `SUICIDE` and all variants of `CALL` together with input data, output data, gas usage, the amount transferred, and the success status of each individual action.

## [Subscription API](ref:subscription-api)

Alchemy allows you to subscribe for push updates via Websockets on a variety of real-time alerts, such as pending transactions, log events, new blocks and more!
