title: Address
subtitle: >-
  Display an address (or ENS) along with a utility icon to copy the address. If
  the address is associated with an ENS that has an avatar, this avatar will be
  displayed. If not, a blockie image representation of the address will be
  shown.

By default, the component will show the ENS name (if available) and the address.

You can also choose to display only the ENS name (if available) or the address, by setting the `onlyEnsOrAddress` prop to `true`.

Clicking on the address redirects to the connected wallet's network block explorer. If the wallet is not connected, it redirects to the block explorer of `targetNetworks[0]` You can disable this behaviour with the `disableAddressLink` prop.
