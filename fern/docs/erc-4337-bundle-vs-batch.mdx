## What is a bundle?

A bundle is a group of user operations that a Bundler submits to the Entrypoint contract for routing to the senders' smart contract accounts.

In most cases, senders are only permitted to include a single user operation in a bundle. An exception to this rule occurs when the sender is [staked with the Entrypoint contract](bundler-services#minimum-stake), in such cases, they can send multiple operations in a single bundle. However, this is not a common for most accounts.

User operations in a bundle are mostly isolated from each other. This means if one user operation fails during its execution function, other operations can still succeed.

## What is a batch (transaction batching)?

Transaction batching is a feature or benefit of Account Abstraction. A batch refers to a group of calls that a smart contract account can make inside a single user operation.

To use batching, a user must have a Smart Contract Account (SCA) that supports an execute batch function, and they must construct the entire batch before sending the fully constructed (single) user operation to the Bundler.

### What is atomicity?

Atomicity refers to an "all or nothing" property of a group of calls within a batch, provided the smart contract account supports the feature, where if a single call in the batch fails, all the calls in the group will be reverted.

### Does Alchemy's bundler support batching?

Alchemy's [Bundler endpoint](/reference/eth-senduseroperation) does not natively support batching. Batching needs to be handled by the smart contract account itself.
