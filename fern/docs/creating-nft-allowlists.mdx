# Introduction

Creating NFT allowlists is important because it allows a degree of control over which NFTs are allowed to be used within a particular context. For example, an NFT allowlist could be used to specify which NFTs are allowed to be used in a particular game, marketplace, or other application. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as to enforce certain rules or regulations, to ensure compatibility with certain systems, or to maintain the integrity or security of the application. By creating an NFT allowlist, it is possible to ensure that only approved NFTs are used within a particular context, which can help to prevent fraud, errors, or other issues from occurring. Overall, NFT allowlists are a valuable tool for creating more controlled and predictable environments for NFTs.
