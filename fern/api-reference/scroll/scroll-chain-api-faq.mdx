## What is Scroll Chain?

Scroll Chain is a scalable and high-performance blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) with an emphasis on speed and low transaction costs. It aims to provide developers with an efficient and user-friendly environment for building and deploying their projects.

## What is the Scroll Chain API?

The Scroll Chain API facilitates interaction with the Scroll Chain network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. It provides developers with tools to interact with the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the Scroll Chain API?

Explained in [Scroll Chain API Quickstart](/reference/scroll-chain-api-quickstart).

## Is Scroll Chain EVM compatible?

Yes, Scroll Chain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows Ethereum developers to port their projects to Scroll Chain with minimal changes, benefiting from the chain's scalability and low transaction fees.

## What API does Scroll Chain use?

Scroll Chain uses the JSON-RPC API standard for blockchain interactions. This is the same standard used by Ethereum.

## What is a Scroll Chain API key?

When accessing the Scroll Chain network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Scroll Chain?

Given Scroll Chain's EVM compatibility, popular Ethereum libraries like ethers.js and web3.js are fully compatible with Scroll Chain. This allows for seamless development and integration for those familiar with Ethereum's development ecosystem.

## What programming languages work with Scroll Chain?

Similar to Ethereum, Scroll Chain supports a range of programming languages for blockchain interaction and smart contract development, including Solidity for smart contracts, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript for dApp development and off-chain interactions.

## What does Scroll Chain use for gas?

Scroll Chain uses SCROLL, its native cryptocurrency, for transaction fees, gas, and other network activities.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Scroll Chain API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy supports for the Scroll Chain API on [Scroll Chain API Endpoints](/reference/scroll-chain-api-endpoints) page.
