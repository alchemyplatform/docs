# Introduction

Starknet is a decentralized Validity-Rollup (often referred to as ZK-Rollup). It operates as a Layer 2 network over Ethereum, enabling any app to achieve massive scale without compromising Ethereum's composability and security.

# What is Starknet API?

The Starknet API is a collection of JSON-RPC methods that allow developers to interact with the Starknet network. By using the endpoints provided by the API, developers can access up-to-date network data and submit transactions to it.

# Getting Started Instructions

## 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Before you begin, you'll need to choose a package manager to manage dependencies in your project. The two most popular package managers for Node.js are `npm` and `yarn`. You can choose the one you're most comfortable with.

### npm

To get started with `npm`, follow the documentation to install Node.js and `npm` for your operating system: [https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### yarn

To get started with `yarn`, follow these steps: [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

## 2. Set up your project (npm or yarn)

Let's start by setting up a simple Node.js project. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text npm
  mkdir alchemy-starknet-api
  cd alchemy-starknet-api
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```text yarn
  mkdir alchemy-starknet-api
  cd alchemy-starknet-api
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will create a new directory called `alchemy-starknet-api` and initialize a new Node.js project in it.

## 3. Make Your First Request

To make requests to the Starknet API, you'll need to use an HTTP client. In this guide, we'll use Axios, a popular HTTP client for Node.js. Install Axios as a dependency in your project with the command below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```Text npm
  npm install axios
  ```

  ```Text yarn
  yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next, let's create a script that will make a request to the `starknet_blockNumber` JSON-RPC method on Starknet. Create a new file called `index.js` in your project directory and add the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  const axios = require('axios');

  const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your Alchemy API key
  const url = `https://starknet-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${apiKey}`;

  const payload = {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'starknet_blockNumber',
    params: []
  };

  axios.post(url, payload)
    .then(response => {
      console.log('Block Number:', response.data.result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=starknet-docs).

## 4. Run Script

To run the script and make the request to the Starknet API, execute the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

As a result, should see the current block number on Starknet printed to the console!

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  Block Number: 42390
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully made your first request to the Starknet API using Alchemy. From here, you can explore the various [JSON-RPC methods available on Starknet](/reference/starknet-getclasshashat) and start building your decentralized applications on it!
