## What is Superseed?

Superseed is a high-performance, EVM-compatible blockchain designed for speed, scalability, and seamless developer experience. It allows for fast finality, low fees, and a familiar Ethereum-style interface â€” making it ideal for building smart contract-based applications.

## What is the Superseed API?

The Superseed API enables developers to interact with the Superseed blockchain using standard JSON-RPC methods. Through the API, you can retrieve block and transaction data, send signed transactions, interact with smart contracts, and more â€” all using tools and patterns familiar to Ethereum developers.

## How can I get access to the Aptos API?

This chain is available only with [Blast](/node/blast-api/blast-quickstart) access.

## How can I get started using the Superseed API?

Check out our [Superseed API Quickstart](/reference/superseed-api-quickstart) guide for setup instructions, sample code, and your first API call.

## Does Superseed support smart contracts?

Yes. Superseed is fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts, meaning you can write and deploy contracts in Solidity, use common tooling like Hardhat or Foundry, and interact with them via standard JSON-RPC calls.

## What API standard does Superseed use?

Superseed uses the Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC API standard. This means most Ethereum libraries and tooling will work out of the box.

## What is a Superseed API key?

When accessing the Superseed Chain network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

## Which libraries can I use with the Superseed API?

Libraries commonly used with Ethereum â€” like `ethers.js`, `web3.js`, or `viem` â€” are fully compatible with Superseed. You can also use standard HTTP clients like `axios`, `fetch`, or `curl` for custom integrations.

## What programming languages are compatible with the API?

Any language that can send HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads can be used â€” including JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, and many others.

## What is used for fees in Superseed?

Transaction fees on Superseed are paid using the network's native token. The fee model follows Ethereumâ€™s EIP-1559 structure, with dynamic base fees and optional tips for prioritization.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Superseed API?

You can find a full list of supported JSON-RPC methods on the [Superseed API Endpoints](/node/superseed/superseed-api-endpoints) page.

## My question isn't listed here â€” where can I get help?
