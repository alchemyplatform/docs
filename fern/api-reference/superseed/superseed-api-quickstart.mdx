# Introduction

The Superseed API allows developers to interact with the Superseed blockchain using standard JSON-RPC methods.

With this API, you can retrieve block and transaction data, send transactions, and build applications powered by Superseedâ€™s high-throughput, EVM-compatible environment.

***

## What is the Superseed Chain API?

The Superseed Chain API enables developers to communicate with the network through JSON-RPC â€” a widely adopted standard for blockchain interactions. If youâ€™re familiar with Ethereumâ€™s API structure, Superseedâ€™s methods will feel intuitive.

Using the API, developers can:

* Fetch the latest blocks and transactions
* Send signed transactions to the network
* Query contract data
* Estimate gas fees and more

## Getting Started Instructions

### 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Your first step involves selecting a package manager, which will be crucial for managing your project's dependencies. The choice between `npm` and `yarn` depends on your personal preference or project requirements.

| npm                                                                                                                       | yarn                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Begin with `npm` by following the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). | For `yarn`, refer to [yarn's installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). |

### 2. Set Up Your Project

To kickstart your project, open your terminal and execute the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text npm
  mkdir superseed-api-quickstart
  cd superseed-api-quickstart
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```text yarn
  mkdir superseed-api-quickstart
  cd superseed-api-quickstart
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a new directory named `superseed-api-quickstart` and initializes a Node.js project within it.

### 3. Make Your First Request

Install Axios, a popular HTTP client, to make API requests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  npm install axios
  # Or with yarn
  # yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and paste the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = `https://superseed-mainnet.alchemy-blast.com/v2/${yourAPIKey}`;

  const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'eth_blockNumber',
  params: []
  };
  axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Block Number:', response.data.result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember to replace `yourAPIKey` with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

### 4. Run Your Script

To execute your script and make a request to the Superseed App, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see the current block number on Superseed App (in hexadecimal format) outputted to your console:

```
Block Number: 0x6d68e
```

## Next Steps

Well done! You've just made your first request to the Superseed App API. With this foundation, you can dive deeper into the array of [JSON-RPC methods available on Superseed App](/node/superseed/superseed-api-endpoints) and start building your dApps on it!
