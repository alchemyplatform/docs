## What is Anime?
Anime is a fast and secure blockchain built on Arbitrum Orbit, designed to support anime content and digital assets.

## What is the Anime API?

The Anime API allows developers to interface with the Anime mainnet and testnet nodes. With this API, developers can execute transactions, query on-chain data, and interact with the Anime network, relying on a JSON-RPC standard.

## How can I get started using the Anime API?

Explained in [Anime API Quickstart](./anime-api-quickstart)

## Is Anime EVM compatible?

Absolutely. Anime confidently supports any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) codebase. This allows developers to smoothly deploy and migrate assets and users from Ethereum L1 and other interoperable chains to Anime.

## What API does Anime use?

Anime utilizes the JSON-RPC API standard. This API is crucial for any blockchain interaction on the Anime network, allowing users to read block/transaction data, query chain information, execute smart contracts, and store data on-chain.

## What is a Anime API key?

When accessing the Anime network via a node provider like Alchemy, Anime developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Anime?

Common Ethereum libraries like [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) and [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.2/) should be compatible with Anime, given its EVM nature.

## What programming languages work with Anime?

Languages that work with Ethereum, such as Javascript, Solidity, Typescript, and Shell, should also be compatible with Anime. Solidity remains the primary choice for smart contract development, while Javascript is ideal for off-chain interactions.

## What does Anime use for gas?

The native cryptocurrency for Animechain is the ANIME token, which is used for transactions, governance, and rewards on the chain.

## What testnet should I use for Anime?

Developers should use the **Anime Sepolia** testnet for Anime. This testnet provides an environment to deploy smart contracts, execute transactions, and test applications.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Anime API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy support for the Anime API on Anime API Endpoints page.
