# alchemy\_pendingTransactions

The `alchemy_pendingTransactions` subscription type subscribes to pending transactions via WebSockets, and filters those transactions based on specified `from` and/or `to` addresses. The subscription will return either full transaction objects or just transaction hashes depending on the request. It will also optionally include re-orged or removed transactions if specified.

<Info>
  When listening to pending transactions with this endpoint, you will only get pending transactions in Alchemy mempool.

# Limits

A maximum of 1000 addresses can be added in the addresses filter for `alchemy_pendingTransactions`.

# Parameters

* `fromAddress` (optional): `string` or \[`array of strings`]
  * Singular address or array of addresses to receive pending transactions sent **from** this address.
* `toAddress` (optional): `string` or \[`array of strings`]
  * Singular address or array of addresses to receive pending transactions **to** this address
* `hashesOnly` (optional): `boolean` default value is `false`, where the response matches the payload of [eth\_getTransactionByHash](/reference/eth-gettransactionbyhash) . If set to `true`, the payload returned contains *only the hashes of the transactions* that are added to the pending state, which matches the payload of [newPendingTransactions](/reference/newpendingtransactions)

<Info />

# Returns

With `hashesOnly` = `true`

* `result`: ***\[string]***- transaction hash for pending transaction
* `subscription`: ***\[string]*** - subscription ID

With `hashesOnly` = `false`

* `result` - ***\[object]*** A transaction object:

  * `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - `null` when it's pending.

  * `from`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address of the sender.
  * `gas`: `QUANTITY` - gas provided by the sender.
  * `gasPrice`: `QUANTITY` - gas price provided by the sender in Wei.
  * `hash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the transaction.
  * `input`: `DATA` - the data send along with the transaction.
  * `nonce`: `QUANTITY` - the number of transactions made by the sender prior to this one.
  * `to`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address of the receiver. `null` when it's a contract creation transaction.
  * `transactionIndex`: `QUANTITY` - `null` when its pending.
  * `value`: `QUANTITY` - value transferred in Wei.
  * `v`: `QUANTITY` - ECDSA recovery id
