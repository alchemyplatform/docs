The `newHeads` subscription type emits an event any time a new header (block) is added to the chain, including during a chain reorganization.

<Info>
  When a chain reorganization occurs, this subscription will emit an event containing all new headers (blocks) for the new chain. This means that you may see multiple headers emitted with the same height (block number), and when this happens the later (highest) block number should be taken as the correct one after a reorganization.
