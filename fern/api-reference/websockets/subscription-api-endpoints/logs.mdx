title: "logs"
description: "Emits logs attached to a new block that match certain topic filters."
url: "https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/logs"
slug: "reference/logs"

The `logs` subscription type emits logs that match a specified topic filter and are included in newly added blocks. To learn more about logs on Ethereum and other EVM chains, check out [Understanding Logs: Deep Dive into eth\_getLogs](/docs/deep-dive-into-eth_getlogs).

<Info>
  When a chain reorganization occurs, logs that are part of blocks on the old chain will be emitted again with the property removed set to `true`. Logs that are part of the blocks on the new chain are also emitted so it is possible to see logs for the same transaction multiple times in the case of a reorganization.

  If `removed` is not included in the response payload then the logs are still a part of the canonical chain.

# Parameters

An object with the following fields:

* `adddress` (optional): `string`] or `[array of strings]` Singular address or array of addresses. Only logs created from one of these addresses will be emitted.

* `topics`: an array of topic specifiers (**up to 4 topics allowed per address**).

  * Each topic specifier is either `null`, a single string, or an array of strings.
  * For every non `null` topic, a log will be emitted when activity associated with that topic occurs.

Below you can find the explanation for individual properties of the response:

* **`jsonrpc`**: The `jsonrpc` property specifies the version of the JSON-RPC protocol that is being used, which in this case is "2.0".
* **`method`**: The `method` property specifies the method that was called, which in this case is `eth_subscription`.
* **`params`**: The `params` property contains the parameters of the method call. In this case, it contains a `subscription` property, which specifies the subscription identifier, and a `result` property, which contains the result of the subscription.
* **`result`**: The `result` property contains information about a specific transaction on the Ethereum blockchain.
* **`address`**: The `address` property specifies the address from which this log originated.
* **`blockhash`**: The `blockHash` property specifies the hash of the block in which the transaction was included.
* **`blockNumber`**: The `blockNumber` property specifies the number of the block in which the transaction was included. It is encoded as a hexadecimal string.
* **`data`**: Contains one or more 32 Bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
* **`logIndex`**: The `logIndex` property specifies the index or position of the log entry within the block. It is encoded as a hexadecimal string.
* **`topics`**: An array of 0 to 4 32 bytes topic hashes of indexed log arguments (up to 4 topics allowed per address).
* **`transactionHash`**: The `transactionHash` property specifies the hash of the transaction.
* **`transactionIndex`**: The `transactionIndex` property specifies the index or position of the transaction within the block. It is encoded as a hexadecimal string.
