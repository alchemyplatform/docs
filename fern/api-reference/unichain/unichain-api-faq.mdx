## What is Unichain?

Unichain is a DeFi-native Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, designed to be the home for liquidity across chains. It aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions while supporting cross-chain liquidity.

## What are the key features of Unichain?

1. **Instant transactions**: Unichain launches with 1-second block times, with plans to achieve 250 ms block times in the future.
2. **Reduced cost and further decentralization**: Unichain leverages Ethereum's scaling roadmap by moving execution to an L2, lowering transaction costs by approximately 95%.
3. **Cross-chain liquidity**: Unichain supports seamless transactions across multiple chains, facilitating easy access to liquidity regardless of the user's chain.

## What is the Unichain API?

The Unichain API allows developers to interact with the Unichain network through a set of JSON-RPC methods. It supports various operations such as smart contract deployment, transaction processing, and data retrieval, enabling developers to integrate Unichain's functionality into their applications.

## How can I get started using the Unichain API?

Explained in the [Unichain API Quickstart](/reference/unichain-api-quickstart) guide.

## Is Unichain EVM compatible?

Yes, Unichain is EVM-compatible as it's built as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution.

## What programming languages can I use with Unichain?

You can use Solidity for smart contract development. For off-chain interactions, you can use languages that support Ethereum libraries like JavaScript (with ethers.js or web3.js).

## What API does Unichain use?

Unichain utilizes the JSON-RPC API standard, which is widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem. This provides a familiar and efficient interface for blockchain interactions.

## What is a Unichain API key?

When accessing the Unichain network via a service provider like Alchemy, developers need an API key to send transactions and retrieve data. An API key ensures secure and authenticated access to the network.

## Where can I find more detailed information about Unichain?

For more comprehensive information, refer to the Unichain Whitepaper and explore the official documentation at [https://docs.unichain.org/docs](https://docs.unichain.org/docs)

## How does Unichain improve market efficiency?

By reducing latency with faster block times, Unichain increases the frequency of arbitrage and lowers value lost to MEV (Miner Extractable Value).

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Unichain API?
