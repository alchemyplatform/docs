## What is Rootstock?

Rootstock is the first and longest-lasting Bitcoin sidechain. It combines the security of Bitcoin's proof of work with Ethereum's smart contract capabilities, offering an open-source, EVM-compatible platform secured by over 60% of Bitcoin's hashing power.

## What is the Rootstock API?

The Rootstock API allows developers to interact with the Rootstock network through a set of JSON-RPC methods. It supports various operations such as smart contract deployment, transaction processing, and data retrieval, enabling developers to integrate Rootstock's functionality into their applications.

## How can I get started using the Rootstock API?

Explained in [Rootstock API Quickstart](/reference/rootstock-api-quickstart).

## Is Rootstock EVM compatible?

Yes, Rootstock is fully EVM-compatible. This allows developers to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts and applications on the Rootstock network with minimal modifications, leveraging existing Ethereum development tools and practices.

## What API does Rootstock use?

Rootstock utilizes the JSON-RPC API standard, which is widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem. This provides a familiar and efficient interface for blockchain interactions.

## What is an Rootstock API key?

When accessing the Rootstock network via a service provider, developers need an API key to send transactions and retrieve data. An API key ensures secure and authenticated access to the network.

## Which libraries support Rootstock?

As an EVM-compatible blockchain, Rootstock supports popular Ethereum libraries such as Web3.js and Ethers.js. This allows developers to leverage existing tools and knowledge when building on Rootstock.

## What programming languages work with Rootstock?

Rootstock supports Solidity for smart contract development due to its EVM compatibility. For off-chain interactions, developers can use JavaScript, TypeScript, or other common web development languages.

## What does Rootstock use for gas?

Rootstock uses RBTC (Rootstock Bitcoin) as its native token for gas fees. RBTC is pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin, allowing users to leverage Bitcoin's value within the Rootstock ecosystem.

## How does Rootstock relate to Bitcoin?

Rootstock is a sidechain of Bitcoin that uses merge mining, allowing Bitcoin miners to simultaneously mine both chains. This provides Rootstock with a high level of security by leveraging Bitcoin's extensive mining network.

## What is the Powpeg mechanism?

The Powpeg is Rootstock's security mechanism based on a layered "defence-in-depth" model. It facilitates the transfer of bitcoins between the Bitcoin and Rootstock blockchains.
