# Introduction

The Bitcoin API gives developers access to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain through a standard set of JSON-RPC methods. With this API, you can retrieve block and transaction data, inspect the mempool, broadcast transactions, and more.

Unlike EVM chains, Bitcoin uses a UTXO-based model and exposes its functionality via the JSON-RPC protocol. This quickstart will help you make your first request.

## What is the Bitcoin Chain API?

The Bitcoin Chain API allows applications to communicate with a Bitcoin node using the JSON-RPC protocol. Unlike Ethereumâ€™s account-based model, Bitcoin relies on a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, which means that balances are tracked by outputs that are explicitly spent or unspent.

Alchemyâ€™s Bitcoin API gives developers a consistent interface to query blockchain data, submit transactions, and monitor network activity. This includes:

* Retrieving raw or decoded transaction data
* Querying block headers and full blocks
* Monitoring mempool entries and states
* Submitting and testing raw transactions

If youâ€™ve worked with Ethereum or other JSON-RPC-compatible chains, the structure will feel familiar, though the data returned may differ in structure and semantics.

## Getting Started Instructions

### 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Your first step involves selecting a package manager, which will be crucial for managing your project's dependencies. The choice between `npm` and `yarn` depends on your personal preference or project requirements.

| npm                                                                                                                       | yarn                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Begin with `npm` by following the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). | For `yarn`, refer to [yarn's installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). |

### 2. Set Up Your Project

To kickstart your project, open your terminal and execute the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text npm
  mkdir bitcoin-api-quickstart
  cd bitcoin-api-quickstart
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```text yarn
  mkdir bitcoin-api-quickstart
  cd bitcoin-api-quickstart
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a new directory named `bitcoin-api-quickstart` and initializes a Node.js project within it.

### 3. Make Your First Request

Install Axios, a popular HTTP client, to make API requests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  npm install axios
  # Or with yarn
  # yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and paste the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = `https://bitcoin-mainnet.alchemy-blast.com/v2/${yourAPIKey}`;

  const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'getblockcount',
  params: []
  };

  axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
  console.log('Current block height:', response.data.result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
  console.error('Error fetching block count:', error);
  });

  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember to replace `yourAPIKey` with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

### 4. Run Your Script

To execute your script and make a request to the Bitcoin App, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see the current block number on Bitcoin App (in hexadecimal format) outputted to your console:

```
Current block height: 0x6d68e
```

## Next Steps

Well done! You've just made your first request to the Bitcoin App API. With this foundation, you can dive deeper into the array of [JSON-RPC methods available on Bitcoin App](/node/bitcoin/bitcoin-api-endpoints) and start building your dApps on it!
