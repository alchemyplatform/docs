# Introduction

Aptos is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain designed for scalability, safety, and upgradeability. It leverages the Move programming language and a novel consensus mechanism to achieve high throughput and low latency.

With its modular architecture, Aptos supports frequent and instant upgrades, making it a dynamic platform for developers and users alike.

## What is the Aptos Chain API?

The Aptos API provides developers with a set of tools to interact with the Aptos blockchain.

It offers both RESTful and JSON-RPC endpoints, allowing for seamless integration, transaction management, wallet interactions, and more.

Key features include:

* Account and Wallet Management: Create and manage Aptos accounts, check balances, and send/receive tokens.
* Transaction Handling: Initiate, sign, and broadcast transactions.
* Blockchain Data: Query blockchain data, such as account balances, block information, and transaction details.
* Smart Contract Execution: Interact with Aptos smart contracts to perform decentralized actions.
* Gas Estimates: Get current gas fees and estimate transaction costs.
* Event Streams: Subscribe to real-time blockchain events through WebSockets.
* Resource Access: Access blockchain resources like token metadata, account states, and more.

## Getting Started Instructions

### 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Your first step involves selecting a package manager, which will be crucial for managing your project's dependencies. The choice between `npm` and `yarn` depends on your personal preference or project requirements.

| npm                                                                                                                       | yarn                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Begin with `npm` by following the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). | For `yarn`, refer to [yarn's installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). |

### 2. Set Up Your Project

To kickstart your project, open your terminal and execute the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text npm
  mkdir aptos-api-quickstart
  cd aptos-api-quickstart
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```text yarn
  mkdir aptos-api-quickstart
  cd aptos-api-quickstart
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a new directory named `aptos-api-quickstart` and initializes a Node.js project within it.

### 3. Make Your First Request

Install Axios, a popular HTTP client, to make API requests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  npm install axios
  # Or with yarn
  # yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and paste the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = `https://aptos-mainnet.alchemy-blast.com/v2/${yourAPIKey}/v1/accounts`;

  axios.get(url)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Accounts:', response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching accounts:', error.message);
  });

  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember to replace `yourAPIKey` with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

### 4. Run Your Script

To execute your script and make a request to the Aptos App, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see a list of Aptos accounts (if any exist on your node or fullnode) outputted to your console. For example:

```
[
  {
    "authentication_key": "0x...",
    "sequence_number": "0",
    "modules": [...],
    "resources": [...]
  }
]
```

## Next Steps

Well done! You've just made your first request to the Aptos App API. With this foundation, you can dive deeper into the array of [JSON-RPC methods available on Aptos App](/node/aptos/aptos-api-endpoints) and start building your dApps on it!
