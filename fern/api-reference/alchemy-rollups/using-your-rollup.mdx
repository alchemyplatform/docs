# Using Your Rollup

After deployment, learn how to interact with your rollup. This guide covers connecting via RPC, bridging assets, and exploring the blockchain.

## RPC Endpoints & API Access

* Your rollup’s RPC URL is available in the Alchemy dashboard.
* Use this URL in your web3 libraries (e.g., viem, ethers.js, web3.js) to interact with the blockchain.
* Standard JSON-RPC methods are supported for reading state and sending transactions.

## Bridging Assets

### Depositing to Rollup

* Use the Bridge UI provided in the dashboard or an external bridge provider.
* Send assets (e.g., ETH, ERC-20 tokens) from your parent chain to your rollup. This involves locking tokens on the parent chain and minting corresponding tokens on rollup.

### Withdrawing to Parent Chain

* Initiate a withdrawal through the Bridge UI.
* For optimistic rollups, there is a challenge period before funds are released.
* For ZK rollups, withdrawals are processed quickly after proof verification.

## Block Explorer

* Each rollup includes a block explorer for inspecting transactions, blocks, and smart contracts.
* Use the explorer to verify contract deployments, monitor transactions, and assess network health.

## Wallet Configuration

* To connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask), add your rollup as a custom network using:

  * Network Name
  * RPC URL
  * Chain ID
  * Currency Symbol
  * Block Explorer URL

These steps ensure you can fully use your rollup for development and testing.

## Deploying Smart Contracts on Your Rollup

Deploying smart contracts to your rollup is similar to deploying on Ethereum. This guide covers the use of popular tools such as Hardhat and Foundry.

## Using Hardhat

1. **Setup Hardhat:** Initialize a new Hardhat project and install the necessary packages.

2. **Configure Network:** Update your `hardhat.config.js` file with a network configuration using your rollup’s RPC URL and Chain ID.

3. **Write a Contract:** Create your Solidity contract in the `contracts/` folder.

4. **Deploy Script:** Write a deployment script (e.g., `scripts/deploy.js`) that utilizes Hardhat’s ethers plugin to deploy your contract.

5. **Deploy:** Execute the deployment script with:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash bash
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your_rollup>
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

6. **Verification:** After deployment, verify your contract on the rollup’s block explorer by uploading your source code.

## Using Foundry (Forge)

1. **Install Foundry:** Set up Foundry on your system.

2. **Initialize Project:** Scaffold a new project with `forge init`.

3. **Configure Network:** Set your RPC URL and private key in your configuration.

4. **Deploy:** Use Forge to compile and deploy your contract:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash bash
     forge create --rpc-url $ROLLUP_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY path/to/YourContract.sol:YourContract
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

## Alternative Tools

* **Remix:** Connect Remix to your rollup via your wallet’s custom RPC settings and deploy directly through the browser.
* **Other Frameworks:** Tools like Truffle or Brownie can also be configured to deploy contracts using your rollup’s RPC endpoint.

Follow these instructions to deploy and verify your contracts, enabling you to build and interact with your new rollup.
