# FAQ & Troubleshooting

This section addresses frequently asked questions and common troubleshooting topics for your Alchemy Rollup.

**Q: How is a rollup different from a sidechain or appchain?**

A: A rollup leverages Layer-1 security by posting transaction data or proofs to the main chain, reducing costs while ensuring high throughput. Sidechains, on the other hand, operate with their own validators and separate security assumptions.

**Q: Do I need to manage validators or sequencers myself?**

A: No. The sequencer and associated infrastructure are managed as part of the service.

**Q: What happens if the sequencer goes down?**

A: Our system includes robust redundancy and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime. In the rare event of an outage, users can still withdraw funds once normal operations resume.

**Q: How do I connect my wallet to the rollup?**

A: Add the rollup as a custom network in your wallet by using the RPC URL, Chain ID, currency symbol, and block explorer URL provided in your dashboard.

**Q: Can I run my own full node?**

A: Yes. Running a full node allows you to independently verify transactions and maintain a trustless view of the network. Detailed instructions for setting up a node are available in our technical guides.

**Q: How can I increase the transaction throughput of my rollup?**

A: Throughput can be optimized by adjusting parameters such as block gas limits, employing data compression techniques, and increasing batch sizes. Our team is available to provide performance tuning guidance.

**Q: How do I calculate transaction fees?**

A: Transaction fees consist of an L2 execution cost and an L1 inclusion cost. The platform calculates these fees dynamically, and detailed fee breakdowns are available in the dashboard.

**Q: Can I change the gas token after deployment?**

A: Changing the gas token post-deployment is complex and typically requires launching a new rollup. It is best to decide on the token during the initial configuration.

**Q: How do I get help if I encounter issues?**

A: For support, use the dedicated channels provided in the dashboard or join our community forums. Detailed troubleshooting guides are also available online.
