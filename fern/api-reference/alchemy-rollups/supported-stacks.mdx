# Supported Rollup Frameworks

Alchemy Rollups supports multiple rollup frameworks. This guide provides an overview of each framework to help you choose the best option for your project.

## Optimism OP Stack

* **Overview:** An open-source optimistic rollup framework designed for Ethereum equivalence.

* **Key Benefits:**

  * Low fees and high throughput.
  * Security through fraud proofs and reliance on Ethereum for data.
  * Full EVM compatibility.
  * [Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/superchain/superchain-explainer), a network of chains that share bridging, decentralized governance, upgrades, a communication layer and more.

* **Use Case:** Ideal for projects looking for a balance of performance and compatibility.

## Arbitrum Nitro (Orbit)

* **Overview:** A robust optimistic rollup with enhancements for performance.

* **Key Benefits:**

  * Ultra-low transaction fees with options for even lower costs through alternative data availability models.
  * Fast block times and efficient batching.
  * Full EVM compatibility, with optional support for additional smart contract languages.
  * Interoperability with other chains in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
  * [**Stylus**](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/hello-stylus-6b18fecc3a22), which will allow you to write smart contracts in a more performant VM with Rust, C++, or other languages that can compile to WASM. These contracts can interoperate synchronously with the EVM.

* **Use Case:** Best suited for high-throughput applications with diverse transaction requirements.

## zkSync ZK Stack

* **Overview:** A framework for building ZK-Rollups using zero-knowledge proofs.

* **Key Benefits:**

  * Instant finality due to cryptographic proofs.
  * High scalability by posting only proofs and minimal data on Layer-1.
  * EVM compatibility with a few potential limitations.
  * Security based on cryptographic guarantees rather than challenge periods.

* **Use Case:** Ideal for applications that require fast withdrawals and enhanced scalability.

Select the framework that aligns with your projectâ€™s needs.
