## What is Arbitrum Nova?

Arbitrum Nova is a layer 2 scaling solution designed to provide fast, low-cost transactions for Ethereum. It leverages optimistic rollups to achieve high throughput and security, enabling developers to build scalable decentralized applications (dApps) with ease.

## What is the Arbitrum Nova API?

The Arbitrum Nova API facilitates interaction with the Arbitrum Nova network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. It allows developers to interact with the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the Arbitrum Nova API?

Explained in [Arbitrum Nova API Quickstart](/reference/arbitrum-nova-api-quickstart).

## Is Arbitrum Nova EVM compatible?

Yes, Arbitrum Nova is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows Ethereum developers to port their projects to Arbitrum Nova with minimal changes, benefiting from the network's scalability and low transaction fees.

## What API does Arbitrum Nova use?

Arbitrum Nova uses the JSON-RPC API standard for blockchain interactions. This is the same standard used by Ethereum.

## What is an Arbitrum Nova API key?

When accessing the Arbitrum Nova network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.
