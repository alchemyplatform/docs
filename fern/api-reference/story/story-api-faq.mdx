## What is Story?
Story is a purpose-built EVM-compatible blockchain that enables fast, transparent, and programmable management, licensing, and monetization of intellectual property on-chain.

## What is the Story API?

The Story API allows developers to interface with the Story mainnet and testnet nodes. With this API, developers can execute transactions, query on-chain data, and interact with the Story network, relying on a JSON-RPC standard.

## How can I get started using the Story API?

Explained in [Story API Quickstart](./story-api-quickstart)

## Is Story EVM compatible?

Absolutely. Story confidently supports any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) codebase. This allows developers to smoothly deploy and migrate assets and users from Ethereum L1 and other interoperable chains to Story.

## What API does Story use?

Story utilizes the JSON-RPC API standard. This API is crucial for any blockchain interaction on the Story network, allowing users to read block/transaction data, query chain information, execute smart contracts, and store data on-chain.

## What is a Story API key?

When accessing the Story network via a node provider like Alchemy, Story developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Story?

Common Ethereum libraries like [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) and [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.2/) should be compatible with Story, given its EVM nature.

## What programming languages work with Story?

Languages that work with Ethereum, such as Javascript, Solidity, Typescript, and Shell, should also be compatible with Story. Solidity remains the primary choice for smart contract development, while Javascript is ideal for off-chain interactions.

## What does Story use for gas?

The native currency for the Story blockchain is the IP token (ticker: IP), which is used for transaction fees (gas), staking, governance, and securing the network.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Story API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy support for the Story API on Story API Endpoints page.
