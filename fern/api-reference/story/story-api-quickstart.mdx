*To use the Story API you'll need to [create a free Alchemy account](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) first!*

## Introduction

Story is a purpose-built EVM-compatible blockchain that enables fast, transparent, and programmable management, licensing, and monetization of intellectual property on-chain.

## What is the Story API?

The Story API allows interaction with the Story network through a set of JSON-RPC methods. Its design is familiar to developers who have worked with Ethereum's JSON-RPC APIs, making it intuitive and straightforward to use.

## Getting Started Instructions

### 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Select a package manager to manage your project's dependencies. Choose between `npm` and `yarn` based on your preference or project requirements.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  # Begin with npm by following the npm documentation
  # https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  # For yarn, refer to yarn's installation guide
  # https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Set Up Your Project

Open your terminal and execute the following commands to create and initialize your project:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  mkdir story-api-quickstart
  cd story-api-quickstart
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  mkdir story-api-quickstart
  cd story-api-quickstart
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a new directory named `story-api-quickstart` and initializes a Node.js project within it.

### 3. Make Your First Request

Install Axios, a popular HTTP client, to make API requests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install axios
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and paste the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = 'https://story-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${your-api-key}';

  const payload = {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'eth_blockNumber',
    params: []
  };

  axios.post(url, payload)
    .then(response => {
      console.log('Latest Block:', response.data.result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember to replace `your-api-key` with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

### 4. Run Your Script

Execute your script to make a request to the Story network:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see the latest block information from Story's network outputted to your console:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  Latest Block: 0x...
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've made your first request to the Story network. You can now explore the various JSON-RPC methods available on Story and start building your dApps on this innovative platform.
