## Introduction

Geist is a curated blockchain infrastructure powering high-quality crypto gaming experiences. Built on Arbitrum technology, it uses `$GHST` as its native gas token, enhancing the token's utility. Geist prioritizes quality over quantity, offering a members-only approach, world-class developer tools, and innovative features like native VRF. As the onchain home of Aavegotchi, Geist aims to redefine crypto gaming with a focus on user engagement and sustainability.

## What is the Geist API?

The Geist API allows interaction with the Geist network through a set of JSON-RPC methods. Its design is familiar to developers who have worked with Ethereum's JSON-RPC APIs, making it intuitive and straightforward to use.

## Getting Started Instructions

### 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Select a package manager to manage your project's dependencies. Choose between `npm` and `yarn` based on your preference or project requirements.

| npm                                                                                                                       | yarn                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Begin with `npm` by following the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). | For `yarn`, refer to [yarn's installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). |

### 2. Set Up Your Project

Open your terminal and execute the following commands to create and initialize your project:

```shell
mkdir geist-api-quickstart
cd geist-api-quickstart
npm init --yes
```

```shell
mkdir geist-api-quickstart
cd geist-api-quickstart
yarn init --yes
```

This creates a new directory named `geist-api-quickstart` and initializes a Node.js project within it.

### 3. Make Your First Request

Install Axios, a popular HTTP client, to make API requests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  npm install axios
  # Or with yarn
  # yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and paste the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = 'https://geist-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${your-api-key}';

  const payload = {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'eth_blockNumber',
    params: []
  };

  axios.post(url, payload)
    .then(response => {
      console.log('Latest Block:', response.data.result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember to replace `your-api-key` with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

### 4. Run Your Script

Execute your script to make a request to the Geist mainnet:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see the latest block information from Geist's mainnet outputted to your console:

```shell
Latest Block: 0x...
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've made your first request to the Geist network. You can now explore the various [JSON-RPC methods available on Geist](/reference/geist-api-endpoints) and start building your dApps on this innovative platform.
