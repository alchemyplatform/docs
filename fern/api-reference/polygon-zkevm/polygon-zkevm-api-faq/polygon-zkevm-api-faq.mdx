# What is Polygon zkEVM?

[Polygon zkEVM](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/) is a decentralized [Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/sidechains-vs-layer2s) that uses cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to offer validity and quick finality to off-chain transactions. Emulating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), zkEVM allows for transparent deployment of existing Ethereum smart contracts while enhancing scalability, security, and transaction throughput. By utilizing zkEVM, developers can build decentralized applications with quick finality and improved performance, all within the Ethereum ecosystem.

# What is the Polygon zkEVM API?

The Polygon zkEVM API allows applications to connect to a Polygon zkEVM node that is part of the Polygon zkEVM network. Developers can interact with on-chain data and send different types of transactions to the network by utilizing the endpoints provided by the API. The API follows a JSON-RPC standard. JSON-RPC is a stateless, lightweight, remote procedure call (RPC) protocol encoded in JSON.

## How can I get started using the Polygon zkEVM API?

Explained in the [Polygon zkEVM API Quickstart Guide](/reference/polygon-zkevm-api-quickstart#getting-started-instructions).

## Is Polygon zkEVM EVM compatible?

Yes, Polygon zkEVM is fully opcode compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is designed to emulate the EVM by recreating all existing EVM opcodes, which allows for transparent deployment of existing Ethereum smart contracts. By achieving compatibility with the EVM, Polygon zkEVM enables developers to seamlessly deploy and interact with smart contracts on the Layer 2 solution

## What API does Polygon zkEVM use?

Polygon uses the JSON-RPC API standard as its API. The Polygon zkEVM JSON-RPC API serves as the backbone for the Polygon zkEVM network and powers any blockchain interaction.

In aggregate, this API suite allows users to read block/transaction data, query chain information, execute smart contracts, store data on-chain, etc. Developers and consumers alike interact with Polygon zkEVMâ€™s base JSON-RPC APIs to communicate with its decentralized network of nodes.

## What is a Polygon zkEVM API key?

When accessing the Polygon network via a node provider like Alchemy, Polygon zkEVM developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=polygon-zkevm)!

## Which libraries support Polygon zkEVM?

The most popular libraries that support Polygon zkEVM are [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) and [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.2/)

## What programming languages work with Polygon zkEVM?

Many programming languages work with Polygon zkEVM including, Javascript, Solidity, Typescript, and Shell. Javascript and Solidity are some of the best languages to use, Solidity for smart contracts and Javascript for off-chain requests.

## What does Polygon zkEVM use for gas?

Polygon zkEVM does not have its own separate native token. Instead, it uses ETH for transactions, gas fees, and other network activities. Users can bridge ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon zkEVM via [Polygon Portal](https://support.polygon.technology/support/solutions/articles/82000906535-how-to-bridge-funds-from-ethereum-mainnet-to-polygon-zkevm-via-polygon-portal).

## What testnet should I use for Polygon zkEVM?

The testnet you should use for Polygon zkEVM is the zkEVM Public Testnet. By connecting to this testnet, you can launch smart contracts, execute transactions, and test applications on the zkEVM network.

Additionally, you can obtain test tokens from the [Goerli testnet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) and use the [Polygon zkEVM bridge](https://public.zkevm-test.net/) to transfer these tokens to the zkEVM Public Testnet. This process allows you to test out the capabilities of the Polygon zkEVM network in a testnet environment before deploying to the mainnet.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Polygon zkEVM API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy support for the Polygon zkEVM API on the [Polygon zkEVM API Endpoints](/reference/polygon-zkevm-api-endpoints) page.
