This document provides a comprehensive list of differences between the Ethereum and Polygon zkEVM. The list includes supported EIPs, opcodes, JSON-RPC differences and additional changes made to build the zkEVM.

## JSON RPC Method Differences

The following JSON RPC methods have differences in zkEVM as compared to EVM. The methods and their differences in zkEVM are as follows:

* [`eth_call`](/reference/eth-call-polygon-zkevm) → doesn't support state override at the moment and pending block, this will be implemented in the [issue 1990](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node/issues/1990) and doesn't support `from` values that are smart contract addresses, this will be implemented in the [issue 2017](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node/issues/2017)
* [`eth_estimateGas`](/reference/eth-estimategas-polygon-zkevm) → if the block number is set to `pending` it is assumed to be `latest`
* [`eth_getBalance`](/reference/eth-getbalance-polygon-zkevm) → if the block number is set to `pending` it is assumed to be `latest`
* [`eth_getCode`](/reference/eth-getcode-polygon-zkevm) → if the block number is set to `pending` it is assumed to be `latest`
* [`eth_getStorageAt`](/reference/eth-getstorageat-polygon-zkevm) → if the block number is set to `pending` it is assumed to be `latest`
* [`eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`](/reference/eth-gettransactionbyblocknumberandindex-polygon-zkevm) → if the block number is set to `pending` it is assumed to be `latest`
* [`eth_sendRawTransaction`](/reference/eth-sendrawtransaction-polygon-zkevm) → can relay TXs to another node

## Additional `zkEVM_*` methods

The zkEVM includes additional JSON-RPC methods which are listed below:

* [`zkevm_consolidatedBlockNumber`](/reference/zkevm-consolidatedblocknumber-polygon-zkevm)
* [`zkevm_isBlockConsolidated`](/reference/zkevm-isblockconsolidated-polygon-zkevm)
* [`zkevm_isBlockVirtualized`](/reference/zkevm-isblockvirtualized-polygon-zkevm)
* [`zkevm_batchNumberByBlockNumber`](/reference/zkevm-batchnumberbyblocknumber-polygon-zkevm)
* [`zkevm_batchNumber`](/reference/zkevm-batchnumber-polygon-zkevm)
* [`zkevm_virtualBatchNumber`](/reference/zkevm-virtualbatchnumber-polygon-zkevm)
* [`zkevm_verifiedBatchNumber`](/reference/zkevm-verifiedbatchnumber-polygon-zkevm)
* [`zkevm_getBatchByNumber`](/reference/zkevm-getbatchbynumber-polygon-zkevm)
* [`zkevm_getBroadcastURI`](/reference/zkevm-getbroadcasturi-polygon-zkevm)

## Opcodes

This section lists out the changes with Opcodes in zKEVM as compared to the EVM.

* **SELFDESTRUCT** → removed and replaced by **SENDALL**.
* **EXTCODEHASH** → returns the hash of the contract bytecode from the zkEVM state tree without checking if the account is empty.
* **DIFFICULTY** → returns "0" instead of a random number as in the EVM.
* **BLOCKCHASH** → returns all previous block hashes instead of just the last 256 blocks.

> **BLOCKCHASH** is the state root at the end of a processable transaction and is stored on the system smart contract.

* **NUMBER** → returns the number of processable transactions.

## Precompiled Contracts

The following precompiled contracts are supported in the zkEVM:

* [**ecRecover**](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/autoapi/ethereum/frontier/vm/precompiled_contracts/ecrecover/index.html)
* [**identity**](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/autoapi/ethereum/frontier/vm/precompiled_contracts/identity/index.html)

Other precompiled contracts have no effect on the zkEVM state tree and are treated as a `revert`, returning all gas to the previous context and setting the `success` flag to "0".

## Additions

**zk-counters** → batch resources are available, linked to state-machine components, as a supplementary addition to gas computation.

## Other Minor Differences

* zkEVM doesn't clean storage when a contract is deployed at an address due to the zkEVM state tree specification.
* **JUMPDEST** opcode is allowed in push bytes to avoid runtime bytecode analysis.
* The zkEVM implements [EIP-3541](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541) from the [London hardfork](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#london).
* [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) which defines **Typed Transaction Envelope**, is not supported.
* [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930), which defines the **Optional Access Lists** transaction type, is not supported.
