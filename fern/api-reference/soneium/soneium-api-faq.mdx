## What is Soneium?

Soneium is an innovative Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain platform developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs. It aims to integrate Web3 technologies into everyday life, creating an inclusive digital ecosystem where everyone can be a creator and innovator. Soneium provides a robust infrastructure for developers to build impactful decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets, while offering users a secure and user-friendly environment for interacting with blockchain technology.

## What is the Soneium API?

The Soneium API allows developers to interact with the Soneium network through a set of [JSON-RPC methods](/reference/soneium-api-endpoints) . It supports various operations such as smart contract deployment, transaction processing, and data retrieval, enabling developers to integrate Soneium's functionality into their applications.

## How can I get started using the Soneium API?

For a step-by-step guide on getting started with the Soneium API, please refer to our [Soneium API Quickstart](/reference/soneium-api-quickstart) guide.

## Is Soneium EVM compatible?

Yes, Soneium is EVM-compatible. This allows developers to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts and applications on the Soneium network, leveraging existing Ethereum development tools and practices.

## What API does Soneium use?

Soneium utilizes the JSON-RPC API standard, which is widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem. This provides a familiar and efficient interface for blockchain interactions.

## What is a Soneium API key?

When accessing the Soneium network via a service provider like Alchemy, developers need an API key to send transactions and retrieve data. An API key ensures secure and authenticated access to the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Soneium?

As an EVM-compatible blockchain, Soneium supports popular Ethereum libraries such as Web3.js and Ethers.js. This allows developers to leverage existing tools and knowledge when building on Soneium.

## What programming languages work with Soneium?

Soneium supports Solidity for smart contract development due to its EVM compatibility. For off-chain interactions, developers can use JavaScript, TypeScript, or other common web development languages.

## What does Soneium use for gas?

Soneium, as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, uses ETH (Ethereum) for gas fees. This is consistent with other Ethereum Layer 2 networks that typically use ETH as their native gas token.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Soneium API?

For a comprehensive list of methods supported by Alchemy for the Soneium API, please refer to the [Soneium API Endpoints](/reference/soneium-api-endpoints) documentation.

## My question isn't here, where can I get help?
