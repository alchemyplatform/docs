*To use the zkSync Era API, you'll need to [create a free Alchemy account](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=zksync-docs) first!*

# Introduction

zkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, leveraging zkRollup technology. It provides low gas fees, high throughput, and enhanced user privacy while maintaining a secure and decentralized architecture.

# What is zkSync Era API?

The zkSync Era API enables developers to interact seamlessly with the zkSync Era network. Through the API, developers can submit transactions, query state changes, and more, all while benefiting from the scalability and security zkSync Era offers.

# Getting Started Instructions

## 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Start by selecting a package manager for managing your project's dependencies. The most commonly used package managers in the Node.js ecosystem are `npm` and `yarn`. Select according to your preference.

### npm

If you're using `npm`, begin by installing Node.js and `npm` by following the guide here: [https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### yarn

If you prefer `yarn`, follow these installation instructions: [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

## 2. Set up your project (npm or yarn)

To set up a Node.js project, open your terminal and execute the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  mkdir alchemy-zksync-api
  cd alchemy-zksync-api
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  mkdir alchemy-zksync-api
  cd alchemy-zksync-api
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a new directory named `alchemy-zksync-api` and initializes a Node.js project within it.

## 3. Make Your First Request

For interacting with the zkSync Era API, you will use an HTTP client. This guide uses Axios, a well-regarded HTTP client for Node.js. Install Axios in your project as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install axios
  ```

  ```Text yarn
  yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next, create a script for sending a request to the `zks_getAllAccountBalances` JSON-RPC method on zkSync Era. This method retrieves the balances of all tokens for a specified account address. Create a file named `index.js` in your project directory and input this code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  const axios = require('axios');

  const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace this with your Alchemy API key
  const url = `https://zksync-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${apiKey}`;

  const payload = {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'zks_getAllAccountBalances',
    params: ['YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS'] // Replace with your account address
  };

  axios.post(url, payload)
    .then(response => {
      console.log('Account Balances:', response.data.result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Be sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Alchemy API key, obtainable from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=zksync-docs), and `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` with the zkSync Era account address you want to query.

## 4. Run Script

To execute the script and send the request to the zkSync Era API, use this command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see the balances of all tokens owned by the specified zkSync Era account displayed in your console:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Shell
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
      "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000": "0x2fbd72a1121b3100"
    },
    "id": 2
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Next Steps

Well done! You've now made your initial request to the zkSync Era API through Alchemy. Proceed to explore the various [JSON-RPC methods available on zkSync Era](/reference/zksync-api-endpoints) to develop your decentralized applications on this powerful Layer 2 platform!
