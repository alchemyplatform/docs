## What is Sonic Chain?

Sonic Chain is a cutting-edge layer-1 blockchain platform offering high performance, scalability, and robust security. With transaction speeds exceeding 10,000 TPS and one-second confirmation times, it is purpose-built to support decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. It aims to provide fast transaction speeds, low costs, and high throughput, making it an attractive option for developers and users alike.

## What is the Sonic Chain API?

The Sonic Chain API facilitates interaction with the Sonic Chain network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. It provides developers with tools to interact with the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the Sonic Chain API?

Explained in [Sonic Chain API Quickstart](/reference/sonic-api-quickstart).

## Is Sonic Chain EVM compatible?

Yes, Sonic Chain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows Ethereum developers to port their projects to Sonic Chain with minimal changes, benefiting from the chain's high performance and low transaction fees.

## What API does Sonic Chain use?

Sonic Chain uses the JSON-RPC API standard for blockchain interactions. This is the same standard used by Ethereum.

## What is a Sonic Chain API key?

When accessing the Sonic Chain network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Sonic Chain?

Given Sonic Chain's EVM compatibility, popular Ethereum libraries like ethers.js and web3.js are fully compatible with Sonic Chain. This allows for seamless development and integration for those familiar with Ethereum's development ecosystem.

## What programming languages work with Sonic Chain?

Similar to Ethereum, Sonic Chain supports a range of programming languages for blockchain interaction and smart contract development, including Solidity for smart contracts, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript for dApp development and off-chain interactions.

## What does Sonic Chain use for gas?

Sonic Chain uses the S Token, its native cryptocurrency, for transaction fees, gas, and other network activities.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Sonic Chain API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy supports for the Sonic Chain API on [Sonic Chain API Endpoints](/reference/sonic-api-endpoints) page.
