## What is Monad Chain?

Monad Chain is a high-performance, Layer 1 blockchain that fully supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It uses parallel execution and the MonadBFT consensus to achieve 10,000 TPS, 500 ms block times, and 1-second finality—all while keeping node hardware requirements low for greater decentralization.

## What is the Monad Chain API?

The Monad Chain API facilitates interaction with the Monad Chain network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. It provides developers with tools to interact with the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the Monad Chain API?

Explained in [Monad Chain API Quickstart](/reference/monad-api-quickstart).

## Is Monad Chain EVM compatible?

Yes. Monad Chain is 100% EVM-compatible at the bytecode level, enabling existing Ethereum smart contracts to run without modifications and work seamlessly with Ethereum’s tooling ecosystem.

## What API does Monad Chain use?

Monad Chain uses the JSON-RPC API standard for blockchain interactions. This is the same standard used by Ethereum.

## What is a Monad Chain API key?

When accessing the Monad Chain network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Monad Chain?

Common Ethereum libraries such as ethers.js, web3.js, and viem are supported, allowing for easy smart contract interaction and wallet management.

## What programming languages work with Monad Chain?

It supports Solidity and Vyper for smart contracts, along with JavaScript and TypeScript for off-chain development, ensuring compatibility with projects that compile to EVM bytecode.

## What does Monad Chain use for gas?

The native token, MONAD, is used for transaction fees. The network implements an EIP-1559-like fee mechanism that adjusts base fees dynamically while allowing users to tip for priority.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Monad Chain API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy supports for the Monad Chain API on [Monad Chain API Endpoints](/reference/monad-api-endpoints) page.
