## What is Flow?

Flow is a layer one blockchain with support for both Solidity and Cadence, a next-gen smart contract language. Any smart contract that works on Ethereum or an EVM L2 works on Flow.

## What is the Flow API?

The Flow API enables interaction with the Flow network through JSON-RPC methods. It provides tools for transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the Flow API?

Refer to the [Flow API Quickstart guide](/reference/flow-api-quickstart) for setup instructions.

## Is Flow EVM-Compatible?

Flow supports full EVM equivalence. Solidity contracts work out of the box on Flow and can access Flow's protocol benefits without code changes. That means solidity devs and can easily tap into Flow's user base and unique IPs without any implementation risk.

## What API does Flow use?

Flow uses a JSON-RPC API standard tailored to its multi-role architecture.

## What is a Flow API key?

When accessing Flow via a node provider, developers use an API key to interact with the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## What programming languages work with Flow?

Flow uses Cadence, a resource-oriented programming language, for smart contracts. For off-chain interactions and dApp development, developers typically use JavaScript, TypeScript, or other web development languages. Flow now also works with Solidity.

## Which libraries support Flow?

Flow has its own set of libraries and tools designed specifically for its ecosystem. However, it also supports integrations with popular libraries like fcl-js (Flow Client Library) which facilitates interaction with the Flow blockchain.

## What does Flow use for gas?

$FLOW, the native cryptocurrency, is used for transaction fees and gas.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Flow API?

Refer to the [Flow API Endpoints page](/reference/flow-api-endpoints) for a complete list of Alchemy-supported methods.
