## What is Berachain?

Berachain is an innovative blockchain platform designed to offer a secure, scalable, and efficient environment for decentralized applications (dApps). It focuses on high transaction throughput, low latency, and robust security, making it a suitable choice for developers looking to build advanced blockchain solutions.

## What is the Berachain API?

The Berachain API facilitates interaction with the Berachain network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. It provides developers with tools to interact with the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the Berachain API?

Explained in [Berachain API Quickstart](/reference/berachain-api-quickstart).

## Is Berachain EVM compatible?

Yes, Berachain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows Ethereum developers to port their projects to Berachain with minimal changes, benefiting from the chain's high performance and low transaction fees.

## What API does Berachain use?

Berachain uses the JSON-RPC API standard for blockchain interactions. This is the same standard used by Ethereum.

## What is a Berachain API key?

When accessing the Berachain network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Berachain?

Given Berachain's EVM compatibility, popular Ethereum libraries like ethers.js and web3.js are fully compatible with Berachain. This allows for seamless development and integration for those familiar with Ethereum's development ecosystem.

## What programming languages work with Berachain?

Similar to Ethereum, Berachain supports a range of programming languages for blockchain interaction and smart contract development, including Solidity for smart contracts, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript for dApp development and off-chain interactions.

## What does Berachain use for gas?

Berachain uses BERA, its native cryptocurrency, for transaction fees, gas, and other network activities.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Berachain API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy supports for the Berachain API on [Berachain API Endpoints](/reference/berachain-api-endpoints) page.
