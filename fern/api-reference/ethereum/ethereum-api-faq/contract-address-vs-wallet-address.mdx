Confusions often arise as to the difference between a wallet address and a contract address mostly because they look similar. However, before we explain how you can differentiate between both addresses, let's take a look at what they mean below.

## What is a contract address?

A contract address is a unique identifier for a smart contract deployed on a blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that follow predefined rules and automatically enforce actions when specific conditions are met.

## What is a wallet address?

A wallet address is a string of letters and numbers from which cryptocurrencies or NFTs can be sent to and from.

## How then can I differentiate between the two addresses

A super easy way to distinguish between a contract address and a wallet address is by calling the `[eth_getCode](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-getcode)` method, which will return a contract code if it's a contract and nothing if it's a wallet. Here's an example of both using our composer tool:

* [0x Contract Address](https://composer.alchemyapi.io/?composer_state=%7B%22network%22%3A0%2C%22methodName%22%3A%22eth_getCode%22%2C%22paramValues%22%3A%5B%220xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498%22%2C%22latest%22%5D%7D)
* [Vitalik's Wallet Address](https://composer.alchemyapi.io/?composer_state=%7B%22network%22%3A0%2C%22methodName%22%3A%22eth_getCode%22%2C%22paramValues%22%3A%5B%220xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B%22%2C%22latest%22%5D%7D)
