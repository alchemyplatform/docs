*To use the Ethereum API you'll need to [create a free Alchemy account](https://alchemy.com/?a=f8afc2202c) first!*

# What is the Ethereum API?

The Ethereum API allows applications to connect to an Ethereum node that is part of the Ethereum blockchain. Developers can interact with on-chain data and send different types of transactions to the network by utilizing the endpoints provided by the API. The API follows a JSON-RPC standard. JSON-RPC is a stateless, lightweight, remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that is commonly used when interacting with Ethereum.

# Getting Started Instructions

## 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

For this guide, we will be using npm or yarn as our package manager to install necessary packages.

### npm

To get started with `npm`, follow the documentation to install Node.js and `npm` for your operating system: [https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### yarn

To get started with `yarn`, follow these steps: [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

## 2. Set Up Your Project

To kickstart your project, open your terminal and execute the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  mkdir ethereum-api-quickstart
  cd ethereum-api-quickstart
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  mkdir ethereum-api-quickstart
  cd ethereum-api-quickstart
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Install Axios

For making API requests, we'll use Axios, a widely-used HTTP client. Install Axios with the following command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install axios
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 4. Make Your First Request

You are all set now to use Ethereum API and make your first request. For instance, let's make a request to `get the latest block`. Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and paste the following code snippet into the file.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  import axios from "axios";

  const url = `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${yourAlchemyAPIKey}`;

  const payload = {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'eth_blockNumber',
    params: []
  };

  axios.post(url, payload)
    .then(response => {
      console.log('The latest block number is', parseInt(response.data.result, 16));
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember to replace `yourAlchemyAPIKey` with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

You can also make these requests on testnets like `eth-sepolia` or `eth-holesky` by just replacing the request URL:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text text
  # Mainnet
  https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/
  # Sepolia Testnet
  https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/
  # Holesky Testnet
  https://eth-holesky.g.alchemy.com/v2/
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 5. Run Your Script

To execute your script and make a request to the Ethereum network, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see the latest block number outputted to your console.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  The latest block number is 11043912
  ```
</CodeGroup>
