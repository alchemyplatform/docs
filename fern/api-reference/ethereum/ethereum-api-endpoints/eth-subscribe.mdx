# eth\_subscribe

### Donâ€™t have an API key?

[Get started for free](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=a69baa86fe)

Creates a new subscription for desired events. Sends data as soon as it occurs.

# Parameters

* **Event types**- specifies the type of event to listen to (ex: new pending transactions, logs, etc.)
* **Optional params** - optional parameters to include to describe the type of event to listen to (ex: `address`)

# Returns

While the subscription is active, you will receive events formatted as an object described below:

* Event Object:

  * `jsonrpc`: Always "2.0"

  * `method`: Always "eth\_subscription"

  * `params`: An object with the following fields:

    * `subscription`: The subscription ID returned by the `eth_subscribe` call which created this subscription. This ID will be attached to all received events and can also be used to cancel the subscription using [`eth_unsubscribe`](/reference/eth-unsubscribe)
    * `result`: An object whose contents vary depending on the event type.

# Event types

The following event types are accepted in all `eth_subscribe` WebSocket requests through your Alchemy endpoint. You can view the individual docs for example requests and responses.

# WebSocket Limits

* There is a limit of 20,000 WebSocket connections per API Key as well as 1,000 parallel WebSocket subscriptions per WebSocket connection, creating a maximum of 20 million subscriptions per application.

  * The maximum size of a JSON-RPC `batch` request that can be sent over a WebSocket connection is 20
  * Free tier users will be limited to 10 concurrent requests per WebSocket connection.
