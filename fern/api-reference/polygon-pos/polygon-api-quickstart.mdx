# Getting Started Instructions

## 1. Choose a package manager (npm or yarn)

For this guide, we will be using npm or yarn as our package manager to install either `alchemy-sdk` or any other packages.

### npm

To get started with `npm`, follow the documentation to install Node.js and `npm` for your operating system: [https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### yarn

To get started with `yarn`, follow these steps: [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

## 2. Set up your project (npm or yarn)

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Shell (npm)
  mkdir alchemy-polygon-api
  cd alchemy-polygon-api
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```text Shell (yarn)
  mkdir alchemy-polygon-api
  cd alchemy-polygon-api
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Install Alchemy-SDK

Run the following command to install the Alchemy SDK with npm or yarn.

<CodeGroup>
  ```text npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```text yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 4. Make your first request

You are all set now to use Polygon PoS API and make your first request. For instance, lets make a request to `get latest block`. Create an `index.js` file and paste the following code snippet into the file.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  const { Network, Alchemy } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Optional Config object, but defaults to demo api-key and eth-mainnet.
  const settings = {
    apiKey: "demo", // Replace with your Alchemy API Key.
    network: Network.MATIC_MAINNET, // Replace with your network.
  };

  const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

  async function main() {
    const latestBlock = await alchemy.core.getBlockNumber();
    console.log("The latest block number is", latestBlock);
  }

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 5. Run script

To run the above node script, use cmd `node index.js`, and you should see the output.

<CodeGroup>
  ```text shell
  The latest block number is 36250231
  ```
</CodeGroup>
