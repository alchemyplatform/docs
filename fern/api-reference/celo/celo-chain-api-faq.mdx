## What is Celo Chain?

Celo Chain is a mobile-first blockchain platform designed to provide accessible financial services to anyone with a mobile phone. It focuses on enabling fast, low-cost transactions and aims to create a decentralized financial system that benefits users and developers alike.

## What is the Celo Chain API?

The Celo Chain API facilitates interaction with the Celo Chain network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. It provides developers with tools to interact with the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the Celo Chain API?

Explained in [Celo Chain API Quickstart](/reference/celo-chain-api-quickstart).

## Is Celo Chain EVM compatible?

Yes, Celo Chain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows Ethereum developers to port their projects to Celo Chain with minimal changes, benefiting from the chain's mobile-first approach and low transaction fees.

## What API does Celo Chain use?

Celo Chain uses the JSON-RPC API standard for blockchain interactions. This is the same standard used by Ethereum.

## What is a Celo Chain API key?

When accessing the Celo Chain network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Celo Chain?

Given Celo Chain's EVM compatibility, popular Ethereum libraries like ethers.js and web3.js are fully compatible with Celo Chain. This allows for seamless development and integration for those familiar with Ethereum's development ecosystem.

## What programming languages work with Celo Chain?

Similar to Ethereum, Celo Chain supports a range of programming languages for blockchain interaction and smart contract development, including Solidity for smart contracts, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript for dApp development and off-chain interactions.

## What does Celo Chain use for gas?

Celo Chain uses CELO, its native cryptocurrency, for transaction fees, gas, and other network activities.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Celo Chain API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy supports for the Celo Chain API on [Celo Chain API Endpoints](/reference/celo-chain-api-endpoints) page.
