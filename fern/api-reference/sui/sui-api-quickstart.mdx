# Introduction

The Sui API enables developers to interact with the Sui blockchain via a collection of JSON-RPC endpoints. With this API, you can query block and transaction data, interact with Move-based smart contracts, manage assets, and more.

Unlike Ethereum-based chains, Sui uses an object-centric data model, optimized for parallel execution and scalability. This quickstart will help you make your first request to the network.

## What is the Sui Chain API?

The Sui Chain API allows developers to send queries and transactions to the Sui blockchain through a JSON-RPC interface. With Suiâ€™s object-based architecture and horizontal scalability, developers benefit from high throughput and low-latency reads and writes.

Alchemyâ€™s Sui API provides developers with consistent and performant access to:

* Retrieving account and object data
* Querying blocks, transactions, and events
* Simulating and broadcasting transactions
* Accessing Move smart contract modules and functions

## Getting Started Instructions

### 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Your first step involves selecting a package manager, which will be crucial for managing your project's dependencies. The choice between `npm` and `yarn` depends on your personal preference or project requirements.

| npm                                                                                                                       | yarn                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Begin with `npm` by following the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). | For `yarn`, refer to [yarn's installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). |

### 2. Set Up Your Project

To kickstart your project, open your terminal and execute the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text npm
  mkdir sui-api-quickstart
  cd sui-api-quickstart
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```text yarn
  mkdir sui-api-quickstart
  cd sui-api-quickstart
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a new directory named `sui-api-quickstart` and initializes a Node.js project within it.

### 3. Make Your First Request

Install Axios, a popular HTTP client, to make API requests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  npm install axios
  # Or with yarn
  # yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and paste the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = `https://sui-mainnet.alchemy-blast.com/v2/${yourAPIKey}`;

  const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'sui_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber',
  params: []
  };

  axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
  console.log('Latest checkpoint sequence number:', response.data.result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
  console.error('Error fetching checkpoint:', error);
  });

  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember to replace `yourAPIKey` with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

### 4. Run Your Script

To execute your script and make a request to the Sui App, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see the latest checkpoint sequence number on Sui App outputted to your console:

```
Latest checkpoint sequence number: 1029433
```

## Next Steps

Well done! You've just made your first request to the Sui App API. With this foundation, you can dive deeper into the array of [JSON-RPC methods available on Sui App](/node/sui/sui-api-endpoints) and start building your dApps on it!
