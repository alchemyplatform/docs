## What is Sui?

Sui is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain developed by Mysten Labs. It is designed to offer low-latency transaction processing, horizontal scalability, and rich on-chain assets using Move, a programming language optimized for secure resource management. Suiâ€™s architecture enables parallel transaction execution, making it well-suited for real-time applications like gaming and social platforms.

## What is the Sui API?

The Sui API allows developers to interact with the Sui blockchain via JSON-RPC and REST endpoints. With the API, you can query chain data, submit transactions, inspect objects and events, and interact with Move-based smart contracts.

## How can I get access to the Aptos API?

This chain is available only with [Blast](/node/blast-api/blast-quickstart) access.

## How can I get started using the Bitcoin API?

Check out our [Sui API Quickstart](/reference/sui-api-quickstart) guide for setup instructions, sample code, and your first API call.

## Does Sui support smart contracts?

Yes. Sui uses the Move programming language to enable secure and performant smart contracts. Contracts can manage on-chain assets and logic and benefit from Suiâ€™s object-centric data model and parallel execution engine.

## What API standard does Sui use?

Sui provides both JSON-RPC and REST APIs for interacting with the network. JSON-RPC is commonly used for state queries and transactions, while REST is suited for lightweight access to metadata and structured data.

## What is a Sui API key?

When accessing the Sui Chain network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

## Which libraries can I use with the Sui API?

You can use any HTTP client such as `axios`, `fetch`, `requests`, or `curl`. The Sui ecosystem also provides SDKs like `@mysten/sui.js` for JavaScript/TypeScript, and `sui-sdk` for Rust and Python.

## What programming languages are compatible with the API?

Any language that can make HTTP or JSON-RPC requests is compatible. Common languages include JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, and Rust.

## What is used for fees in Sui?

Transaction fees on Sui are paid in the networkâ€™s native token, SUI. Fees depend on gas units used, storage costs, and computation complexity.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Sui API?

You can find a full list of supported JSON-RPC methods on the [Sui API Endpoints](/node/sui/sui-api-endpoints) page.

## My question isn't listed here â€” where can I get help?
