## What is Blast Chain?

Blast Chain is a high-performance blockchain designed to deliver rapid transaction speeds and low costs. It focuses on scalability and efficiency, making it an ideal platform for decentralized applications (dApps) that require fast and cost-effective transactions.

## What is the Blast Chain API?

The Blast Chain API facilitates interaction with the Blast Chain network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. It provides developers with tools to interact with the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the Blast Chain API?

Explained in [Blast Chain API Quickstart](/reference/blast-chain-api-quickstart).

## Is Blast Chain EVM compatible?

Yes, Blast Chain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows Ethereum developers to port their projects to Blast Chain with minimal changes, benefiting from the chain's high throughput and low transaction fees.

## What API does Blast Chain use?

Blast Chain uses the JSON-RPC API standard for blockchain interactions. This is the same standard used by Ethereum.

## What is a Blast Chain API key?

When accessing the Blast Chain network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Blast Chain?

Given Blast Chain's EVM compatibility, popular Ethereum libraries like ethers.js and web3.js are fully compatible with Blast Chain. This allows for seamless development and integration for those familiar with Ethereum's development ecosystem.

## What programming languages work with Blast Chain?

Similar to Ethereum, Blast Chain supports a range of programming languages for blockchain interaction and smart contract development, including Solidity for smart contracts, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript for dApp development and off-chain interactions.

## What does Blast Chain use for gas?

Blast Chain uses BLAST, its native cryptocurrency, for transaction fees, gas, and other network activities.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Blast Chain API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy supports for the Blast Chain API on [Blast Chain API Endpoints](/reference/blast-chain-api-endpoints) page.
