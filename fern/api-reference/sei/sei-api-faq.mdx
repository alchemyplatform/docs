## What is Sei?

Sei is a high-performance blockchain designed specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. It offers fast transaction speeds, scalability, and a secure environment, making it an ideal platform for deploying DeFi applications and services.

## What is the Sei API?

The Sei API facilitates interaction with the Sei network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. It provides developers with tools to interact with the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the Sei API?

Explained in [Sei API Quickstart](/reference/sei-api-quickstart).

## Is Sei EVM compatible?

Yes, Sei is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows Ethereum developers to port their projects to Sei with minimal changes, benefiting from the chain's high performance and low transaction fees.

## What API does Sei use?

Sei uses the JSON-RPC API standard for blockchain interactions. This is the same standard used by Ethereum.

## What is a Sei API key?

When accessing the Sei network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support Sei?

Given Sei's EVM compatibility, popular Ethereum libraries like ethers.js and web3.js are fully compatible with Sei. This allows for seamless development and integration for those familiar with Ethereum's development ecosystem.

## What programming languages work with Sei?

Similar to Ethereum, Sei supports a range of programming languages for blockchain interaction and smart contract development, including Solidity for smart contracts, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript for dApp development and off-chain interactions.

## What does Sei use for gas?

Sei uses SEI, its native cryptocurrency, for transaction fees, gas, and other network activities.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Sei API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy supports for the Sei API on [Sei API Endpoints](/reference/sei-api-endpoints) page.
