## What is Lens Network?

Lens Network is a decentralized social networking infrastructure built on top of Ethereum. It aims to create open and fair social spaces designed for mass adoption, leveraging zkSync's ZK Stack technology to achieve scalability, security, and decentralization.

## What is the Lens Protocol?

Lens Protocol is the core set of smart contracts that power the Lens Network. It enables users to own their social graph and data, allowing for interoperable social applications and features like profiles, posts, comments, and follows.

## How does Lens Network differ from traditional social media?

Lens Network is onchain, meaning user data is distributed across a network of computers rather than controlled by a single entity. This gives users ownership of their social media identity and connections, allowing for greater freedom of expression and less censorship at the network level.

## What technology does Lens Network use?

Lens Network is built on zkSync's ZK Stack, utilizing zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup technology. It will implement a hybrid architecture combining Validium and Volition scaling solutions to achieve high scalability while maintaining security.

## What are the phases of Lens Network's rollout?

Lens Network will be rolled out in three phases:

1. Seed: Validium on Ethereum
2. Grow: Introduction of a Data Availability (DA) provider
3. Bloom: Full implementation of Volition technology

## What is Validium?

Validium is a scaling solution that computes and posts state transitions to Ethereum while storing the state itself in a separate data availability location. This approach helps keep transaction costs down while maintaining security.

## What is Volition?

Volition is a scaling setup that enables two different transaction policies on the same infrastructure. It allows for using Validium for social transactions and rollup for financial transactions, providing flexibility in balancing security and scalability.

## How will Lens Network improve user experience?

Lens Network aims to offer a smooth user experience comparable to Web2 applications, including:

* Gasless and signless transactions
* Embedded wallet support
* Easy bridging across networks
* Subsecond transaction completion times

## Will the new Lens Network be cross-chain compatible?

Yes, the new version of Lens Protocol will function as a cross-chain protocol. While the main hub will be on Lens Network with zkSync, instances can be deployed on other EVM (and non-EVM) networks, allowing developers to build social applications on various supported networks.

## What happens to existing Lens Protocol users and applications?

Users and applications can continue using the existing Lens Protocol and later migrate to Lens Network if they choose. The Lens team will support a smooth migration process for those who wish to transition.

## How does Lens Network address the blockchain "trilemma"?

Lens Network addresses the blockchain trilemma (balancing scalability, security, and decentralization) by using ZK rollup technology and a hybrid architecture. This approach allows for high scalability while maintaining sufficient security for social interactions and full security for financial transactions.

## How can developers get involved with Lens Network?

Developers are encouraged to build new experiences on the Lens Network architecture. They can participate in discussions and contribute feedback through the LIP (Lens Improvement Proposal) process.
