## What is ZetaChain?

ZetaChain is a decentralized blockchain network designed to enhance cross-chain compatibility and interoperability. It aims to provide a seamless experience for developers building decentralized applications (dApps) that need to interact with multiple blockchains.

## What is the ZetaChain API?

The ZetaChain API facilitates interaction with the ZetaChain network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. It allows developers to interact with the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as transactions, smart contract deployment, and data retrieval.

## How can I get started using the ZetaChain API?

Explained in [ZetaChain API Quickstart](/reference/zetachain-api-quickstart).

## Is ZetaChain EVM compatible?

Yes, ZetaChain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows Ethereum developers to port their projects to ZetaChain with minimal changes, benefiting from the network's cross-chain capabilities and robust infrastructure.

## What API does ZetaChain use?

ZetaChain uses the JSON-RPC API standard for blockchain interactions. This is the same standard used by Ethereum.

## What is a ZetaChain API key?

When accessing the ZetaChain network via a node provider like Alchemy, developers use an API key to send transactions and retrieve data from the network.

For the best development experience, we recommend that you [sign up for a free API key](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/)!

## Which libraries support ZetaChain?

Given ZetaChain's EVM compatibility, popular Ethereum libraries like ethers.js and web3.js are fully compatible with ZetaChain. This allows for seamless development and integration for those familiar with Ethereum's development ecosystem.

## What programming languages work with ZetaChain?

Similar to Ethereum, ZetaChain supports a range of programming languages for blockchain interaction and smart contract development, including Solidity for smart contracts, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript for dApp development and off-chain interactions.

## What does ZetaChain use for gas?

ZetaChain uses ZETA, its native cryptocurrency, for transaction fees, gas, and other network activities.

## What methods does Alchemy support for the ZetaChain API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy supports for the ZetaChain API on [ZetaChain API Endpoints](/reference/zetachain-api-endpoints) page.
