Below are some common questions about accessing and using Blast networks through Alchemy.

### What is Blast?

Blast is a collection of blockchain APIs for networks that are not included by default in the Alchemy dashboard. These include both EVM and non-EVM chains that are supported through the same developer experience as standard APIs.

### Do I need a special plan to access Blast networks?

Yes. These networks are only made available **upon request**, as they are not enabled by default.

### How do I request access to a Blast network?

You can request support by reaching out to [account-abstraction@alchemy.com](mailto:account-abstraction@alchemy.com).

### Are Blast networks available in the Alchemy dashboard?

Not initially. Blast networks are **not visible in the dashboard** by default.

### Which chains are currently available via Blast?

See the [Supported Chains](./supported-chains) page for an up-to-date list of available and upcoming networks.
