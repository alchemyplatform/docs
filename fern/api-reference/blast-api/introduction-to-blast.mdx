## Introducing Blast: The Most Affordable Purpose-Built RPC for Historical Blockchain Data

**Blast** is Alchemy’s dedicated, high-throughput Core RPC API optimized for **read-only access to historical blockchain data**. It is designed to power use cases such as **indexing**, **backfilling**, and **historical analytics**—eliminating the cost and complexity of real-time infrastructure you don’t need.

Unlike general-purpose RPC providers, Blast removes real-time transaction capabilities and live-chain features to deliver **affordable, reliable access to past blockchain states**. It supports **100+ networks** via a single API key and offers enterprise-grade scale with **99.9% uptime** across geographies.

## Who Should Use Blast?

Blast is purpose-built for teams that require large-scale historical reads, such as:

* **Marketplaces & Indexers**\
  Reconstruct complete transaction histories across multiple chains to populate user profiles, asset listings, and analytics dashboards.

* **Oracles & Data Providers**\
  Backfill datasets or verify past on-chain states without needing access to latest mempool or chain-tip data.

* **Data Aggregators & Explorers**\
  Process millions of block calls for research or auditability without incurring the high costs of real-time RPC services.

## Limitations of Blast

Blast is intentionally scoped to meet specific historical data needs:

* **Read-Only, Historical Access Only**\
  No writes or real-time reads. ETH\_CALLs are restricted to blocks **25+ blocks behind tip**

* **No WebSockets, Mempool, or Event Subscriptions**\
  Real-time functionality like eth\_subscribe or pending tx monitoring is excluded to keep performance and costs optimized for historical work

* **Limited Developer Tooling**\
  Features like usage charts or response logs are minimal. For richer debugging or monitoring, Supernode may be more appropriate.

* **Slightly Lower Uptime**\
  Blast offers **99.9% reliability** vs. Supernode’s 99.99%. For use cases that can tolerate minor delays and handle retries, this offers substantial savings.

## How to Get Blast

Blast is currently available to **enterprise customers only**.

* If you’re already an Alchemy enterprise customer, please reach out to your **Alchemy Sales POC** for access.
