*Everything you need to know about Alchemy’s high-throughput RPC for historical data*

## What is Blast?

**Blast** is Alchemy’s purpose-built RPC service for **read-only, high-scale access to historical blockchain data**. It’s engineered for teams that need to query past chain states at extreme volume—like indexers, analytics platforms, explorers, and oracles—without paying for real-time features they don’t need.

Blast eliminates write capabilities, webSockets, and redundancy to offer a more **cost-efficient** solution for historical reads.

## Who should use Blast?

Blast is ideal for engineering teams with **batch-based, data-heavy workloads**, such as:

* 🧾 **Marketplaces & Indexers**

  Backfill user activity, asset metadata, or contract interactions across chains.

* 📊 **Analytics & Data Science Teams**

  Query full blockchain histories for modeling, reporting, or anomaly detection.

* 🔮 **Oracles & Infrastructure Providers**

  Retrieve accurate historical values or validate chain state over time.

## What are the limitations of Blast?

Blast is optimized for historical reads and intentionally excludes features that are unnecessary for that use case:

| **Feature** | **Supported?** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Write support (eth\_sendTx) | ❌ | Use Supernode for tx submission |
| Tip-of-chain reads | ❌ | Reads begin ~25 blocks behind tip (~30s delay) |
| WebSockets / subscriptions | ❌ | No eth\_subscribe, no event streams |
| Mempool access | ❌ | No pending tx data |
| Developer tooling | 🔸 Limited | No usage charts or response logs |
| New chain support | ⏳ Slight delay | Launches a few days to weeks after Supernode |
| Uptime SLA | ✅ 99.9% | Versus Supernode’s 99.99% |

## How do I get started with Blast?

Blast is currently available to **Alchemy enterprise customers**. To get access:

1. Contact your **Alchemy sales or solutions rep** to request access.
2. Once approved, create a new **Blast app** in your Alchemy dashboard.
3. Copy the **API key** and drop it into your existing SDK config.

> ✅ Blast supports the same SDKs and request formats as Supernode—just with historical-only access.

Read more about Blast API endpoints [here](../reference/blast-supported-chains).

## How far behind is the chain tip?

All Blast reads are delayed by **~25 blocks (~30 seconds)** behind the current chain head. This applies to all supported networks and allows for:

* Enhanced caching
* Greater throughput
* Lower infrastructure overhead

This delay is fixed and not configurable.

## What chains does Blast support?

Blast supports **100+ EVM-compatible networks**, including:

* Ethereum Mainnet
* Polygon
* Arbitrum
* Optimism
* Base
* Avalanche
* And many more

Note: **New chain support launches first on Supernode**, with Blast availability following after stability and caching pipelines are in place.

## **Can I use Blast and Supernode together?**

Absolutely—and we recommend it.

Use **Blast** for:

* Historical reads
* Indexing and backfills
* Long-range analytics

Use **Supernode** for:

* Real-time dashboards
* Wallet interactions
* Live dApps

Routing traffic between both services helps optimize for both cost and performance.

## How can I monitor my usage?

Blast currently offers minimal in-product monitoring:

* No built-in usage charts
* No request logs or traces

We recommend integrating with your own observability stack (e.g. DataDog, Grafana, OpenTelemetry) to monitor request behavior and usage volume.
