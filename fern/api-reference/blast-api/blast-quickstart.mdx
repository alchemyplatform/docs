🚀 **Available only with [Blast](../reference/introduction-to-blast#how-can-i-get-it) access**

### 1. Check Chain Availability

Start by visiting our [Chain Overview](../../reference/blast-supported-chains) to verify if your target chain is supported on Blast.

### 2. Getting started

Getting started is as easy as copy pasting your API key found in your blast dashboard.

Log into your [Blast Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/blast), create a Blast app and copy your project’s API key.

> 🎯 This key is used exactly as you would configure a Supernode request — simply replace the endpoint with your Blast URL.

### 3. Update Your Configuration

Here’s how to configure a request using the Blast URL with your API key:

```js
const axios = require("axios");

const url = `https://<chain>-mainnet.alchemy-blast.com/v2/your-api-key`;

const payload = {
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: "eth_blockNumber",
  params: [],
  id: 1,
};

axios.post(url, payload).then(res => {
  console.log("Block number:", res.data.result);
});
```

## Available on Blast

### 🔍 Read-Only Historical Data

* Ideal for:
  * Historical queries
  * Data analytics
  * Indexing use cases
* Not recommended for real-time, user-facing transactions
* Expect a ~30 second delay across all supported chains

### ✅ 99.9% Reliability

While Supernode offers “four nines” (99.99%) reliability, Blast is optimized for cost-efficiency:

| Feature             | Supernode        | Blast               |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Uptime SLA          | 99.99%           | 99.9%               |
| Max Downtime/Month  | ~4 minutes       | ~7 hours            |
| Failover Infra      | Automatic        | Manual (or none)    |

> 💡 Blast is ideal for large-scale infrastructure teams looking to reduce redundancy and costs.

### 🧪 Secondary Access to New Chains

* Supernode provides day 1 support for new chains
* Blast typically supports them a few days or weeks later
* Ideal if you don’t need immediate access during early launch phases
