## Introduction

**Blast** is a set of Alchemy-supported blockchain APIs that are not part of the default network offering. These APIs cover additional chains, both EVM and non-EVM, and are made available upon request.

Blast endpoints are intended for developers who want to build on networks that are not included by default in the standard Alchemy dashboard, but are still supported through the same infrastructure and tooling.
