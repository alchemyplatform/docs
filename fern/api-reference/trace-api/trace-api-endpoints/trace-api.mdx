| [trace\_call](/reference/trace-call)                                       | Executes the given call and returns a number of possible traces for it.                  |
| [trace\_block](/reference/trace-block)                                     | Returns traces created at given block.                                                   |
| [trace\_get](/reference/trace-get)                                         | Returns trace at given position.                                                         |
| [trace\_filter](/reference/trace-filter)                                   | Returns traces matching given filter.                                                    |
| [trace\_transaction](/reference/trace-transaction)                         | Returns all traces of the given transaction.                                             |
| [trace\_rawTransaction](/reference/trace-rawtransaction)                   | Traces a call without making the call, returning the traces.                             |
| [trace\_replayBlockTransactions](/reference/trace-replayblocktransactions) | Replays all transactions in a block returning the requested traces for each transaction. |
| [trace\_replayTransaction](/reference/trace-replaytransaction)             | Traces a call without making the call, returning the traces.                             |

## What exactly is the Trace API?

Is this a standard RPC endpoint, or is it something Alchemy has developed?

The Trace API is a set of non-standard RPC methods developed by the OpenEthereum team and is now maintained by the Erigon team, not by Alchemy. See [https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC-trace-module](https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC-trace-module).

## What is the difference between the Ethereum Trace API and Debug API?

The [Trace API](/reference/trace-api-quickstart), which is supported by Erigon node clients, is equivalent to Geth's [Debug API](/reference/debug-api-quickstart). The Debug API offers more API methods than the Trace API and is more widely used because Geth is a more popular Ethereum node client. To compare the [Trace API vs. Debug API](/reference/trace-api-vs-debug-api), read our API comparison guide.
