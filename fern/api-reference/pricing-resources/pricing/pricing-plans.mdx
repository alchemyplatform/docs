## Throughput (CUPS)

Each application has reserved dedicated throughput, measured in Compute Units per Second (CUPS). Your app can exceed these limits based on elastic demand in our system.

| Tier       | Base CUPS |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Free       | 1,000     |
| PAYG       | 10,000    |
| Enterprise | Custom    |

*Note: Even if your application limit is lower, the system may allow higher throughput based on available capacity. For a more robust experience, we recommend implementing retries when experiencing throughput errors.*
