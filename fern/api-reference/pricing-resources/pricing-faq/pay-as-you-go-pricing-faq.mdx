Our goal is to accelerate development onchain by providing the most developer-friendly web3 infrastructure pricing.

We firmly believe that costs shouldnâ€™t be a barrier to building innovative apps onchain. Weâ€™ve worked hard to optimize our infrastructure to reduce our costs, and weâ€™re excited to pass on those savings to you.

This FAQ answers what you need to know about our Pay As You Go plan.

1. **What is Pay As You Go plan?** Pay As You Go is our new pricing plan. You only pay for what you use, with no platform fees. Rates start at $0.45 per million Compute Units and automatically decrease to $0.40 per million Compute Units after you hit 300M Compute Units.

2. **When is Pay As You Go plan available?** The new pricing plan launches on February 1st, 2025.

3. **What does Pay As You Go plan include?** Check out [alchemy.com/pricing](http://alchemy.com/pricing) for full details.

4. **How do I calculate my costs under the Pay As You Go plan?** $0.45 per million Compute Units until you hit 300M monthly Compute Units. After 300M, your rate drops to $0.40 per million Compute Units.

   ```text
   For an app using 120M Compute Units / month:

   - You pay 120* $0.45 = $54/month

   For an app using 460M Compute Units / month:

   - First 300M: 300*$0.45 = $135/month
   - After 300M: 160*$0.40 = $64/month
   - You pay $135 + $64 = $199/month
   ```

5. **How do Compute Units work?** Each API request uses Compute Units (CUs) based on its complexity. Check out [this breakdown of Alchemy's compute unit costs](/reference/compute-unit-costs) per method, chain, and product. On average, one API request uses about 25 CUs, though this can vary. For example, 4M requests typically use around 100M CUs.

6. **How does Pay As You Go plan work for Subgraphs?**

   Our old pricing (before Feb 1st, 2025) is below:

   |                          | Free | Growth ($49/mo) | Scale ($199/mo) |
   | ------------------------ | ---- | --------------- | --------------- |
   | Deployments              | 2    | 10              | 30              |
   | Queries                  | 500K | 1M              | 10M             |
   | Extra Queries            | â€“    | $50/M           | $25/M           |
   | Rate Limit (queries/sec) | 5    | 10              | 30              |
   | Stored Entities          | 250K | 500K            | 2.5M            |
   | Extra Stored Entities    | â€“    | $50/M           | $30/M           |

   Our new pricing (after Feb 1st, 2025) is as follows:

   |                          | Free | Pay As You Go |
   | ------------------------ | ---- | ------------- |
   | Deployments              | 2    | 30            |
   | Queries                  | 200K | $20/M         |
   | Rate Limit (queries/sec) | 5    | 30            |
   | Stored Entities          | 100K | $25/M         |

   Weâ€™re getting rid of the base fees and allotments from our prior plans. Starting Feb 1st, 2025, thereâ€™s a single, reduced rate for queries ($20/M) and stored entities ($25/M) to reflect exactly how much youâ€™re using.

9. What do I need to know if Iâ€™m an existing Scale or Growth Customer? Check out all details [here](/reference/new-pricing-for-existing-scale-and-growth-customers).

10. Iâ€™m a free plan user! What happens after I hit 100M Compute Units?

    We offer **the most generous free plan** in the industry. Our free plan gives you **10x the capacity** to build for free compared to competitors, even after we adjusted capacity to 100M monthly Compute Units (previously 300M). You get massive computing power and throughput to start building right away.

    When you're ready to scale beyond 100M Compute Units per month, Pay As You Go plan provides a seamless path forward with competitive rates that get cheaper when you build more.
