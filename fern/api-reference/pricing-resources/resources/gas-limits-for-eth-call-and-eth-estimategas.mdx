A breakdown of the gas cap limits for `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism.

**NOTE:** The gas limit specified in the table below applies to individual `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` requests on both mainnet and testnets.

| Chain    | Gas Limit   |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Ethereum | 550 million |
| Polygon  | 550 million |
| Optimism | 550 million |
| Arbitrum | 550 million |
