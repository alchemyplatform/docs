# Alternative Query

The alternative to using `alchemy_getTransactionReceipts` would be to use the Ethereum JSON-RPC API to retrieve the list of transaction hashes for the block using [`eth_getBlockByNumber`](/reference/eth-getblockbynumber) or [`eth_getBlockByHash`](/reference/eth-getblockbyhash) methods and then use [`eth_getTransactionReceipt`](/reference/eth-gettransactionreceipt) to retrieve the receipt for each transaction. This approach requires making multiple API calls, one for each transaction receipt. This is way slower than `alchemy_getTransactionReceipts` due to the large number of API calls.

Overall, `alchemy_getTransactionReceipts` is performant and simple-to-use at the same time.

# Use Cases

`alchemy_getTransactionReceipts` can be used in a variety of use cases where developers need to retrieve transaction receipts for a specific block. Some examples include:

* **Extracting data for analysis**: Developers may need to extract data from transaction receipts for analysis purposes, such as measuring transaction volumes, gas usage, or average block times.

* **Building a blockchain explorer**: Developers building blockchain explorers may need to retrieve all transaction receipts for a given block in order to display details about the transactions in a user-friendly way.

* **Building decentralized applications**: Decentralized applications (dApps) may need to retrieve transaction receipts to confirm the success or failure of a transaction in order to execute subsequent transactions or operations.
