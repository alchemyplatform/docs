alchemy\_getTokenMetadata - Returns metadata (name, symbol, decimals, logo) for a given token contract address. This endpoint is supported on Ethereum and many L2s, including Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, World Chain and more. See the full list of supported networks [here](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/chains?service=token-api\&utm_source=readme\&utm_medium=link\&utm_campaign=docs_method_chains_link_v1_tokens).

### Helpful tips

`name`, `symbol` and `decimals` are **optional** methods in the ERC-20 token standard. Therefore, not all contracts will respond correctly to calls requesting this information. While the incorrectness or absence of `name` and `symbol` can be an inconvenience, having the correct `decimals` is absolutely crucial in displaying token balances or converting user inputs accurately when communicating with the contract.

### How is token metadata updated?

Alchemy maintains a regularly updated database of contract metadata, with values gathered and intelligently merged from the contracts themselves along with several other sources. Alchemy is therefore able to provide clean, accurate, up-to-date metadata for contracts that may be missing any of these methods or have changed their name or symbol since contract publication.

As a bonus, token logo images are available for many of the popular tokens.
