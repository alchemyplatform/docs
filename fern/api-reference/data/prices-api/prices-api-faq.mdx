### How are prices calculated?

[Each endpoint](/reference/prices-api-quickstart#endpoints) has slight different price sources: By Symbol combines CEX and DEX data, whereas By Address only relies on DEX data.

For each token, the price is aggregated by averaging exchange prices (weighted by total volume).

### What tokens do you support?

By Symbol: We support the top 1000+ token symbols by market cap.

By Address: 10K+ tokens from all the leading DEXes.

Need another token? Reach out to us [here](https://www.alchemy.com/support).

### How are new tokens added?

Tokens are made available as soon as they’re published to CEXes or DEXes.

We pull from 10+ CEXes, including:

Binance Coinbase Crypto.com Kraken OKX Bybit KuCoin

We pull from 100+ DEXes, including:

Raydium Curve Pancakeswap V2/V3 Orca Uniswap V2/V3/V4 Aerodrome Balancer V2 Meteora Sushiswap V3 Velodrome Camelot V3 Pharaoh Exchange Quickswap
