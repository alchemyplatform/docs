# Introduction

Alchemy's Address Activity webhooks supports 30+ EVM chains (and now [Solana in early beta)](https://alchemotion.notion.site/External-Solana-Webhooks-Early-Access-Beta-18a069f200668057998afabc01472791). For EVM chains, it tracks all ETH, ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 transfers. This provides your app with real-time state changes when an address sends/receives tokens or ETH. A maximum of 100,000 addresses can be tracked by a single webhook.

# Types of transfers

There are three main types of transfers that are captured when receiving a `fromAddress` activity response.

| Transfer type | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| External ETH  | Top-level transactions from an EOA (Externally Owned Account). |
| Token         | Event logs for ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 transfers.           |
| Internal ETH  | Internal Transfers from a smart contract address.              |

<Warning>
**Note on Internal Transfers**

1. Internal transfers are currently only supported on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism and Base. Support for other networks is a WIP!
2. Internal Transfers with the call type `delegatecall` are not supported on Alchemy. Although they have a value associated with them, they don't transfer a value. For details read the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf). Internal transfer miner rewards are also unsupported on Alchemy.
</Warning>

# Example Response

Whenever one of the addresses that you are tracking sends/receives tokens or ETH, you receive a response from the webhook that looks like this:
