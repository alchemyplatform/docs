<Warning>
  Creation of Mined and Dropped Transaction webhooks has indefinitely been disabled for maintenance purposes. We recommend leveraging [Address Activity webhooks](/reference/address-activity-webhook) to understand when a userâ€™s transactions have been mined! Please reach out on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/alchemyplatform) if you have any questions or require access!

# Introduction

The Mined Transaction webhook notifies your app when a transaction sent through your app (using your API key) gets mined. This is useful for you to further notify the users of your app about the status of the transaction. The Mined Transaction webhook is available on all the networks in Alchemy.

# Example Response

When a transaction sent through your app gets mined, you receive a response from the webhook that looks like this:
