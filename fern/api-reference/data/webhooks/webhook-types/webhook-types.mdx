Alchemy Notify is used to subscribe to event notifications that occur on your application. You can create a webhook to receive notifications on different types of on-chain activity.

Below are the Alchemy webhook types and their supported networks.

| Webhook Type                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [Custom](/reference/custom-webhook)                         | Custom Webhooks allows you to track any smart contract or marketplace activity, monitor any contract creation, or any other on-chain interaction. This gives you infinite data access with precise filter controls to get the blockchain data you need.                                                                                     |
| [Address Activity](/reference/address-activity-webhook)     | Alchemy's Address Activity webhook tracks all ETH, ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 transfers. This provides your app with real-time state changes when an address sends/receives tokens or ETH. Specify the addresses for which you want to track this activity via API as well. A maximum of 100,000 addresses can be added to a single webhook. |
| [NFT Activity](/reference/nft-activity-webhook)             | The NFT Activity webhook allows you to track ERC721 and ERC1155 token contracts for NFTs. This provides your app with real-time state changes when an NFT is transferred between addresses.                                                                                                                                                 |
