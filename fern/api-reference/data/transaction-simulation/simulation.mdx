Transaction simulation allows you to understand the impact of a transaction before sending it on-chain. This helps you:

1. Identify potential issues before they occur
2. Understand state changes that will happen
3. Verify transaction parameters
4. Test complex transaction sequences

## Available Methods

* [Simulate Asset Changes](/reference/simulateassetchanges) - See how a transaction will affect token balances
* [Simulate Execution](/reference/simulateexecution) - Get detailed execution traces and logs
* [Simulate Bundle](/reference/simulatebundle) - Simulate multiple transactions in sequence

## Examples
