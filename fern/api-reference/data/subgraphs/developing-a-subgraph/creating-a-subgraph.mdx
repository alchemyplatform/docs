<Info>
  If you already have a subgraph and are looking to deploy it on Alchemy
  Subgraphs, see [Deploying a Subgraph](/reference/deploying-a-subgraph).
</Info>

# From Scratch

To create a subgraph from scratch:

<CodeGroup>```shell shell graph init --product hosted-service ```</CodeGroup>

# From an Existing Contract

To create a subgraph that indexes all events of an existing contract:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  graph init \
    --product hosted-service
    --from-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
    [--network <ETHEREUM_NETWORK>] \
    [--abi <FILE>] \
    <subgraph name>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The ABI will be fetched from Etherscan. If it can't be found, the `--abi` file will need to be specified.

# From an Example Subgraph

Alchemy Subgraphs has several example subgraphs for you to instantly deploy. See [your dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com) to get started.
