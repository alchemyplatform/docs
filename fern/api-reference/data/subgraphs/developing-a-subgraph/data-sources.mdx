# Overview

Each "data source" within a subgraph manifest corresponds to an Ethereum contract on a specific network.

For example, the following data source pulls Compound v3 data for the USDC deployment:

```shell
specVersion: 0.0.5
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum
    name: Comet
    network: mainnet
    source:
      address: "0xc3d688B66703497DAA19211EEdff47f25384cdc3"
      abi: Comet
      startBlock: 15331586
    mapping:
			...
```

See [full specification](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/subgraph-manifest.md#15-data-source) for more details.

# Adding a Data Source

To add a new data source to an existing subgraph, you can use the `graph add` CLI command:

```shell
graph add <address> [<subgraph-manifest default: "./subgraph.yaml">]

Options:

      --abi <path>              Path to the contract ABI (default: download from Etherscan)
      --contract-name           Name of the contract (default: Contract)
      --merge-entities          Whether to merge entities with the same name (default: false)
      --network-file <path>     Networks config file path (default: "./networks.json")
```

# Proxy Contracts

EVM protocols often use a **proxy contract** that points to an **implementation contract** for the sake of upgradeability.

Event log and transaction data is associated with the **proxy contract** address, but need to be decoded using the **implementation contract** ABI. Because of this, you'll likely need to download the **implementation contract** ABI and associate it with the **proxy contract** address in your data source.

# Factory Contracts

Another common pattern is to use factory or registry contracts that create and manage other smart contracts.

In order to handle sub-contracts that are dynamically created, you'll need to use [Data Source Templates](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#data-source-templates).
