The HTTP endpoint for GraphQL queries can be found on the subgraph page in the dashboard.

# Authentication and API restrictions

## Rate Limits

GraphQL queries are subject to rate limits set on each organization.

Please check your billing dashboard to see rate limit details for your organization.

## Query keys

All GraphQL queries are authenticated using a query key, which can be created and managed from the main dashboard. Your organization can have multiple query keys with the following settings:

* **Origins**: Permitted origins for queries. Wildcard matching is supported (e.g. `*.alchemy.com`).
* **Rate limits** (Coming soon): Queries per second allowed per query key.

Example use cases:

* **From your backend** - Create a query key with no origin restrictions and no rate limit.
* **From your frontend** - Create a query key that allows origins from your domain(s) and has no rate limit.
* **For your community** - Create a query key with a rate limit and no origin restrictions.

## Using query keys

We currently support two ways of passing in query keys into queries â€” by path and by header.

**Path**

The query key can be included as part of the URL path. For example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  curl -v \
  	'https://subgraph.satsuma-prod.com/<QUERY_KEY>/<ORGANIZATION>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>/version/<VERSION_NAME>/api' \
    --data-raw '{"query":"{entities(first:1){id}}"}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Header**

The query key can be attached with a `x-api-key` header. For example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  curl -v \
  	'https://subgraph.satsuma-prod.com/<ORGANIZATION>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>/version/<VERSION_NAME>/api' \
    -H 'x-api-key: <QUERY_KEY>' \
    --data-raw '{"query":"{entities(first:1){id}}"}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Indexing Status

We provide an indexing status endpoint for every subgraph version, which you can find in the dashboard.

It returns the following information:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "data": {
      "indexingStatusForCurrentVersion": {
        "subgraph": "QmXqNgptc2b5WzwmFfCu8PxsLgetBe5M8eBKvSyu5jqkei",
        "synced": true,
        "health": "healthy",
        "fatalError": null,
        "nonFatalErrors": [],
        "chains": [
          {
            "chainHeadBlock": {
              "number": "17787217"
            },
            "latestBlock": {
              "number": "17787217"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
