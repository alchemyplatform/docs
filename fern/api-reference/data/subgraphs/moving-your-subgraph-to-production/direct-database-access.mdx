# Overview

For Enterprise customers, we offer a read-only user to your subgraph's underlying Postgres database.

**Use cases**

* Powering complex SQL aggregations that are difficult with GraphQL.
* Powering internal analytics or dashboards.

# Data schema

Every subgraph maps to a Postgres DB schema, and every entity in your subgraph maps to a table in that schema.

Each table row represents a state of a subgraph entity for a specific block range. Any time that your subgraph changes, the subgraph captures a new row.

Every row will have the following columns:

* `block_start_inclusive`
* `block_end_exclusive`

This allows you to answer complex time-series queries with your subgraph entities. For example:

* You can track how the TVL for a Pool increases over time.
* You can track total protocol users over time.
