<Info>
  Try it out - [alchemy\_simulateAssetChangesBundle](https://alchemyenterprisegroup.readme.io/reference/alchemy-simulateassetchangesbundle) and [alchemy\_simulateExecutionBundle](https://alchemyenterprisegroup.readme.io/reference/alchemy-simulateexecutionbundle).
</Info>

With [Asset Changes](https://alchemyenterprisegroup.readme.io/reference/alchemy-simulateassetchanges) and [Execution Simulation](https://alchemyenterprisegroup.readme.io/reference/alchemy-simulateexecution), you are able to simulate 1 transaction and get asset changes, decoded logs, decoded traces and more.

What about simulating multiple transactions **sequentially**?

For 3 transactions (t1, t2, t3), think of being able to:

* use output of simulating t1 as input to simulating t2
* use output of simulating t2 as input to simulating t3
* etc.

The current bundle limit is 3 transactions. 4500 CU cost.
