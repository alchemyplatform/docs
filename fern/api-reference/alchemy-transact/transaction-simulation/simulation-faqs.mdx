## Do you support NFTs that predate ERC721?

Yes.

We recently added support for the following NFTs that predate the ERC721 standard:

* CryptoKitties
* Cryptopunks

`assetType` will be set to `SPECIAL_NFT` for these collections.

This is consistent with our [Transfers API](/reference/transfers-api-quickstart#6-special-nft-transfers).

| Network     | Name          | Contract Address                           |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Eth Mainnet | CryptoKitties | 0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d |
| Eth Mainnet | CryptoPunks   | 0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb |

## How can I get metadata for NFTs (ERC721, ERC155)?

You can use the collection address (`contractAddress`) and token id (`tokenId`) returned in the response to call our getNFTMetadata endpoint - see [here](/reference/getnftmetadata).

***

## How can I determine if a simulation was successful?

You can check if the top level `error` field is null.

***

## How can I get gas used?

### `alchemy_simulateAssetChanges`

You can access the top level `gasUsed` field.

### `alchemy_simulateExecution`

The API can return a flat or a nested response depending on the 3rd parameter passed in the request (defaults to flat response).

Flat response - `gasUsed` in first call.

Nested response - `gasUsed` in root call of nested response.
