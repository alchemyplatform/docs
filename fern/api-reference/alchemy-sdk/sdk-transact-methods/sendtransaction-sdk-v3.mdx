## Code Sandbox

You can test out the `sendTransaction` method using the code sandbox below:

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `sendTransaction` method:

* **Sending ETH**: `sendTransaction` can be used to send Ether from one Ethereum address to another. This is one of the most common use cases for sendTransaction.

* **Deploying a smart contract**: When you deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain, you need to send a transaction that includes the bytecode of the contract. `sendTransaction` can be used to send this transaction.

* **Interacting with a smart contract**: Once a smart contract has been deployed, you can interact with it by sending transactions that call its functions. `sendTransaction` can be used to send these transactions.

* **Token transfers**: Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain are often built using smart contracts. `sendTransaction` can be used to transfer tokens from one Ethereum address to another.

# Related Methods

Here are the methods related to `sendTransaction`:

* [sendPrivateTransaction](/reference/sendprivatetransaction-sdk): Used to send a single transaction to Flashbots. Flashbots will attempt to send the transaction to miners for the next 25 blocks.
