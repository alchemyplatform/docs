# Description

Returns a fee per gas (in `wei`) that is an estimate of how much you can pay as a priority fee, or "tip", to get a transaction included in the current block.

This number is generally used to set the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` field in a transaction request.

# Response

| Property          | Type     | Description              |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Call the method to display the max priority fee per gas in wei
      const response = await alchemy.transact.getMaxPriorityFeePerGas()

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  }

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  94000000

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` method:

* **Setting optimal gas fees for transactions**: By using the `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` method, developers can ensure that they set optimal gas fees for their transactions. This can help ensure that transactions are processed quickly and efficiently while minimizing user costs.
* **Automating gas fee calculations**: Some applications may need to calculate gas fees for transactions automatically. By using the `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` method, developers can automate this process and ensure that gas fees are always set at the optimal level.
* **Monitoring network congestion**: The value returned by `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` can be an indicator of network congestion. Developers can use this information to monitor the network's health and adjust their gas fees accordingly.
* **Providing transparency to users**: By displaying the current `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` value to users, developers can provide transparency and help users make informed decisions about their transactions.
