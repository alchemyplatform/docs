## Code Sandbox

You can test out the `simulateAssestChanges` method using the code sandbox below:

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `simulateAssetChanges` method:

* **Testing**: Developers can use `simulateAssetChanges` to test their smart contracts before deploying them to a blockchain network. By simulating the changes that would occur, developers can identify potential errors and debug their code.

* **Optimizing asset transactions**: Businesses that regularly perform asset transactions, such as banks or trading firms, can use `simulateAssetChanges` to optimize their transaction strategies. These firms can identify the most efficient ways to move assets between accounts by simulating different transaction scenarios.

# Related Methods

Here are the methods related to `simulateAssestChanges`:

* [simulateAssetChangesBundle](/reference/simulateassetchangesbundle-sdk): Simulates the asset changes resulting from a list of transactions simulated in sequence.
