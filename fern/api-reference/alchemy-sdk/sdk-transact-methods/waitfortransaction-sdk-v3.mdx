Returns a promise which will not resolve until specified transaction hash is mined.If `confirmations` is 0, this method is non-blocking, and if the transaction has not been mined returns `null`. Otherwise, this method will block until the transaction has confirmed blocks mined on top of the block in which it was mined.

# Description

Returns a promise which will not resolve until the specified transaction hash is mined.

If `confirmations` is 0, this method is non-blocking, and if the transaction has not been mined returns `null`. Otherwise, this method will block until the transaction has confirmed blocks mined on top of the block in which it was mined.

## Code Sandbox

You can test out the `waitForTransaction` method using the code sandbox below:

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `waitForTransaction` method:

* **Ensuring transaction execution**: When sending a transaction to the Ethereum network, there is no guarantee that the transaction will be executed immediately. `waitForTransaction` can be used to ensure that the transaction is mined and executed before moving on to the next step in the program.

* **Waiting for contract deployment**: When deploying a new smart contract to the Ethereum network, it may take some time for the contract to be deployed and ready for use. `waitForTransaction` can be used to wait for the contract deployment transaction to be confirmed before interacting with the contract.

* **Checking transaction status**: `waitForTransaction` can be used to check the status of a transaction and ensure that it was successfully mined and confirmed by the network. This is useful for ensuring that funds were successfully transferred, or for verifying that a contract function was executed as expected.
