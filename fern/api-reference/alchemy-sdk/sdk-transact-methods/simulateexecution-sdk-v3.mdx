## Code Sandbox

You can test out the `simulateExecution` method using the code sandbox below:

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `simulateExecution` method:

* **Testing**: You can use `simulateExecution` to test the logic of your smart contract without incurring the cost of actually executing the transaction on the blockchain.

* **Gas estimation**: The method can also be used to estimate the amount of gas required to execute a transaction. This can be useful in determining the appropriate gas limit to set for a transaction to ensure it is processed efficiently.

* **Debugging**: When you encounter errors while interacting with a smart contract, `simulateExecution` can help you debug the issue. By simulating the execution of the transaction, you can identify the specific line of code that is causing the error.

# Related Methods
