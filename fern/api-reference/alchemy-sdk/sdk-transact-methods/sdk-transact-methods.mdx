# Supported Methods

| Method                                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`getTransaction`](/reference/sdk-gettransaction)                         | Returns the transaction with hash or null if the transaction is unknown.                                                                                    |
| [`sendTransaction`](/reference/sdk-sendtransaction)                       | Submits transactions to the network to be mined.                                                                                                            |
| [`sendPrivateTransaction`](/reference/sdk-sendprivatetransaction)         | Used to send a single transaction to Flashbots. Flashbots will attempt to send the transaction to miners for the next 25 blocks.                            |
| [`cancelPrivateTransaction`](/reference/sdk-cancelprivatetransaction)     | Stops the provided private transaction from being submitted for future blocks.                                                                              |
| [`waitForTransaction`](/reference/sdk-waitfortransaction)                 | Returns a promise which will not resolve until the specified transaction hash is mined.                                                                     |
| [`estimateGas`](/reference/sdk-estimategas)                               | Returns an estimate of the amount of gas required to submit transactions to the network.                                                                    |
| [`getMaxPriorityFeePerGas`](/reference/getmaxpriorityfeepergas-sdk)       | Returns a fee per gas (in wei) that is an estimate of how much you can pay as a priority fee, or "tip", to get a transaction included in the current block. |
| [`simulateAssetChanges`](/reference/simulateassetchanges-sdk)             | Simulates the asset changes resulting from a single transaction.                                                                                            |
| [`simulateAssetChangesBundle`](/reference/simulateassetchangesbundle-sdk) | Simulates the asset changes resulting from a list of transactions simulated in sequence.                                                                    |
| [`simulateExecution`](/reference/simulateexecution-sdk)                   | Simulates a single transaction and the resulting and returns list of decoded traces and logs that occurred during the transaction simulation.               |
| [`simulateExecutionBundle`](/reference/simulateexecutionbundle-sdk)       | Simulates a list of transactions in sequence and returns list of decoded traces and logs that occurred for each transaction during simulation.              |
