Returns the transaction with `hash` or `null` if the transaction is unknown.If a transaction has not been mined, this method will search the transaction pool. Various backends may have more restrictive transaction pool access (e.g. if the gas price is too low or the transaction was only recently sent and not yet indexed) in which case this method may also return null.

# Description

Returns the transaction with hash or null if the transaction is unknown.

If a transaction has not been mined, this method will search the transaction pool. Various backends may have more restrictive transaction pool access (e.g. if the gas price is too low or the transaction was only recently sent and not yet indexed) in which case this method may also return null.

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `getTransaction` method:

* **Transaction status**: You can use `getTransaction` to check the status of a transaction by its hash. If the transaction has been mined and confirmed, you will be able to see the block number and other details. If the transaction has not yet been mined, you can use `getTransactionReceipt` to get the current status.

* **Transaction details**: You can use `getTransaction` to retrieve the details of a transaction, including the sender and recipient addresses, the amount transferred, and the gas used. This information can be useful for auditing purposes or to reconcile your own records.

* **Debugging**: If you are experiencing issues with a transaction, you can use `getTransaction` to retrieve the details and identify the source of the problem. For example, if a transaction is failing due to insufficient gas, you can use `getTransaction` to confirm the gas limit and adjust it as needed.

# Related Methods

Here are the methods related to `getTransaction`:

* [sendTransaction](/reference/sendtransaction-sdk) - Submits transaction to the network to be mined.
* [waitForTransaction](/reference/waitfortransaction-sdk) - Returns a promise which will not resolve until specified transaction hash is mined.
