# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `getAllWebhooks` method:

* **Monitoring transactions**: By setting up a webhook for transaction events, you can receive real-time notifications about when transactions are sent or received by your smart contract. This can be useful for tracking the progress of a transaction, and for triggering other actions in response to specific transaction events.

* **Monitoring contract events**: In addition to tracking transactions, you can also set up webhooks to receive notifications when specific events occur within your smart contract. For example, you could set up a webhook to trigger an alert whenever a new user registers on your decentralized application.

* **Managing account balances**: By using webhooks to monitor changes in your account balances, you can keep track of your cryptocurrency holdings in real time. This can be useful for managing your portfolio, and for triggering automated trades or other actions based on changes in your account balances.
