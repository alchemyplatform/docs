<Info>
  Please note that this endpoint is only supported on **Ethereum (Mainnet & Sepolia)**, **Polygon (Mainnet, Mumbai & Amoy)**, **Arbitrum One (mainnet)** & **Optimism (mainnet)**

  For other chains, you could use the [getNFTMetadata](/reference/getnftmetadata-v3) endpoint with the `refreshCache` parameter set to true to refresh the metadata!
</Info>

# Description

Refreshes the cached metadata for a provided NFT contract address and token id. Returns a boolean value indicating whether the metadata was refreshed.

This method is useful when you want to refresh the metadata for an NFT that has been updated since the last time it was fetched.

<Info>
  Note that the backend only allows one refresh per token every 15 minutes, globally for all users. The last refresh time for an NFT can be accessed on the `Nft.timeLastUpdated` field.
</Info>

To trigger a refresh for all NFTs in a contract, use [refreshContract](/reference/refreshcontract-sdk) instead.

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      const contractAddress = "0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d";
      const tokenId = "1";
      //Call the method
      let response = await alchemy.nft.refreshNftMetadata(contractAddress, tokenId)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

## Code Sandbox

You can test out the `refreshNftMetadata` method using the code sandbox below:

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `refreshNftMetadata` method:

* **Up-to-Date NFT Information**: NFT metadata, such as images, descriptions, and attributes, can change over time. By refreshing the metadata, developers ensure that their application displays the most current and accurate information about the NFT, enhancing the user experience.

* **Correcting errors**: Sometimes errors can occur in the metadata associated with an NFT. For example, the wrong image may have been uploaded or the description may contain a typo. The `refreshNftMetadata` method can be used to correct these errors.

* **Improving NFT marketability**: The metadata associated with an NFT can significantly impact its marketability. By updating the metadata, NFT owners can improve the chances of their NFTs being sold or traded.
