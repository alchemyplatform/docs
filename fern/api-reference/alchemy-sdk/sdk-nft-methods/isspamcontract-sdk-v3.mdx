# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `isSpamContract` method:

* **Preventing spam transactions**: If you are building a blockchain-based application or service, you may want to prevent spam transactions from being processed on your network. By checking whether a contract is a spam, you can filter out transactions that are likely to be spam and prevent them from clogging up your network.

* **Improving search results**: If you are building a search engine for smart contracts, you may want to filter out spam contracts from your search results. By using the `isSpamContract` method, you can identify and exclude contracts that are known to be spam.

* **Enhancing security**: If you are building a security system for a smart contract platform, you may want to identify contracts that are known to be malicious or spammy. By using the `isSpamContract` method, you can flag these contracts as high-risk and take additional security measures to protect your platform and users.
