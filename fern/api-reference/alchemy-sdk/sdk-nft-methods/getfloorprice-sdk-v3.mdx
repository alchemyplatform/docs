# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `getFloorPrice` method:

* **NFT marketplaces**: In an NFT marketplace, the `getFloorPrice` method can be used to display the minimum price at which an NFT can be purchased. This helps buyers to determine the minimum price they need to pay for a particular NFT, and also helps sellers to set a minimum price for their NFT.

* **Auctions**: In an auction, the `getFloorPrice` method can be used to determine the minimum bid amount for an item. This helps to ensure that the auction starts at a fair price and helps to prevent low-ball bids.

* **Automated market makers (AMMs)**: In an AMM, the `getFloorPrice` method can be used to determine the minimum price at which a particular token can be bought or sold. This helps to ensure that trades are executed at a fair price and helps to prevent price manipulation.

* **Tokenized real estate**: In the emerging market of tokenized real estate, the `getFloorPrice` method can be used to display the minimum price at which a particular real estate asset can be sold. This helps buyers to determine the minimum price they need to pay for a particular property, and also helps sellers to set a minimum price for their property.
