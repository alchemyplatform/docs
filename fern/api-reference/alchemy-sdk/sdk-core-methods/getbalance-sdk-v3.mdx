# Description

Returns the balance of a given address as of the provided block.

# Parameters

| Name            | Type     | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `addressOrName` | `string` | The address or ENS name of the account to get the balance for.                                 |
| `blockTag`      | `string` | The optional block number or hash to get the balance for. Defaults to `latest` if unspecified. |

### `blockTag` parameters

* `pending` - A sample next block built by the client on top of `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
* `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
* `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is “unlikely” to be re-orged.
* `finalized `- The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged.
* `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

# Response

| Property             | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Promise<BigNumber>` | `object` | This is an estimate of the balance of gas. Properties returned in this object include: 1. `hex`: `string` This is the hex. 2. `type`: `string` BigNumber. |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getBalance` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getbalance.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
    	// This response fetches the balance of the given address in the paramter as of the provided block.
      let response = await alchemy.core.getBalance("vitalik.eth", "latest")

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
      "type": "BigNumber",
      "hex": "0x32a24830b63151ab54"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for the `getBalance` method:

* **Retrieve balance**: One of the most common use cases for `getBalance` is to retrieve the balance of a particular address on the blockchain.

* **Payment verification**: `getBalance` can also be used to verify that a payment has been made or received.
