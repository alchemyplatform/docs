# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getBlockWithTransactions` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getblockwithtransactions.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Assign the hash to a variable
      let txHash = "0x92fc42b9642023f2ee2e88094df80ce87e15d91afa812fef383e6e5cd96e2ed3"

      //Call the method to return the block with transactions
      let response = await alchemy.core.getBlockWithTransactions(txHash)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Use Cases

Here are some possible use cases for this method:

* **Blockchain Explorer**: When building a blockchain explorer, it is important to be able to retrieve detailed information about blocks and their transactions. `getBlockWithTransactions` can be used to fetch this information and display it to users.

* **Smart Contract Verification**: When verifying the correctness of a smart contract execution, it may be necessary to retrieve the block and its transactions that triggered the execution. `getBlockWithTransactions` can be used to fetch this information and verify that the smart contract executed correctly.

* **Payment Processing**: When processing payments on a blockchain, retrieving the block and its transactions that confirm the payment may be necessary. `getBlockWithTransactions` can be used to fetch this information and confirm that the payment was successfully processed.

# Related Methods

Here are the methods related to `getBlockWithTransactions`:

* [getBlock](/reference/getBlock-sdk): Returns the block from the network based on the provided block number or hash.
* [getBlockNumber](/reference/getblocknumber-sdk): Returns the result of executing the transaction, using call.
