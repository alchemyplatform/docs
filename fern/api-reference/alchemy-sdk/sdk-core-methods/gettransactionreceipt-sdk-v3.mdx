# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getTransactionReceipt` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript gettransactionreceipt.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Initialize variables for the parameters
      const tx = "0x88df016429689c079f3b2f6ad39fa052532c56795b733da78a91ebe6a713944b"
      
      //Call the method to fetch the transaction receipt of the tx
      let response = await alchemy.core.getTransactionReceipt(tx)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `getTransactionReceipt` method:

* **Confirming transaction execution**: When a transaction is sent on the Ethereum blockchain, it may take some time to process and confirm it. The `getTransactionReceipt` method can confirm that a transaction has been processed and its status (success or failure).

* **Verifying smart contract execution**: Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain. They can execute transactions and perform various operations on the blockchain. The `getTransactionReceipt` method can be used to verify that a smart contract has been executed as intended and to check its output.

* **Tracking token transactions**: Tokens are a type of digital asset that can be traded on the Ethereum blockchain. The `getTransactionReceipt` method can be used to track token transactions and to verify that they have been executed correctly.

* **Auditing blockchain transactions**: The transparency and immutability of blockchain transactions make them an ideal platform for auditing purposes. The `getTransactionReceipt` method can be used to audit transactions and to ensure that they have been executed correctly and securely.
