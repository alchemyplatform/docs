# Description

Gets all transaction receipts for a given block by number or block hash.

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getTransactionReceipts` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript gettransactionreceipts.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network, Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Define the params object
      const params = {
          // blockNumber
          blockNumber: "0x18760312114f3fdf11f9d5846245995835aa59994d5fc4203faee52d2f7eaabe"
      };

      //The response returns the transaction receipts of the `blockNumber`
      let response = await alchemy.core.getTransactionReceipts(params)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Use Cases

Here are some possible use cases for the `getTransactionReceipts` method:

* **Transaction Confirmation**: You can use `getTransactionReceipts` to check if a transaction has been successfully confirmed by the EVM networks. A transaction receipt contains information such as the block number and transaction status, which can indicate if the transaction was successful or not.

* **Contract Interaction**: When you interact with a smart contract on the EVM networks, you typically receive a transaction hash. You can use `getTransactionReceipts` to retrieve the transaction receipt for that hash, which contains the contract address and any events emitted by the contract during the transaction.

* **Transaction History**: If you need to keep track of the transactions you have sent or received on the EVM networks, you can use `getTransactionReceipts` to retrieve the receipts for those transactions. You can then store this information in your application's database or use it to generate reports.

# Related Methods

Here are the methods related to `getTransactionReceipts`:

* [getTransactionReceipt](/reference/gettransactionreceipt-sdk): Returns the transaction receipt for hash or null if the transaction has not been mined.
