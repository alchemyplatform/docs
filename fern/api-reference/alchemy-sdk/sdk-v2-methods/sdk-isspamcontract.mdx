# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      // define the contract address
      const address = "0x000440f08436a7b866d1ae42db5e0be801da722a";

      //Call the method to check if a contract is a spam
      const response = await alchemy.nft.isSpamContract(address)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  }

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>

## Code Sandbox

You can test out the `isSpamContract` method using the code sandbox below:

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `isSpamContract` method:

* **Preventing spam transactions**: If you are building a blockchain-based application or service, you may want to prevent spam transactions from being processed on your network. By checking whether a contract is a spam, you can filter out transactions that are likely to be spam and prevent them from clogging up your network.

* **Improving search results**: If you are building a search engine for smart contracts, you may want to filter out spam contracts from your search results. By using the `isSpamContract` method, you can identify and exclude contracts that are known to be spam.

* **Enhancing security**: If you are building a security system for a smart contract platform, you may want to identify contracts that are known to be malicious or spammy. By using the `isSpamContract` method, you can flag these contracts as high-risk and take additional security measures to protect your platform and users.
