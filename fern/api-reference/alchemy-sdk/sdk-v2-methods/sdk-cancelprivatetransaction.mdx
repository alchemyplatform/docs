      const response = await alchemy.transact.cancelPrivateTransaction(txHash)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `cancelPrivateTransaction` method:

* **Error in transaction parameters**: If the sender realizes that they have made an error in the transaction parameters, such as sending the wrong amount or specifying the wrong recipient, they can cancel the transaction before it is processed.

* **Privacy concerns**: If the sender realizes that the transaction includes sensitive information that they do not want to be visible on the blockchain, they can cancel the transaction before it is processed.

* **High gas price**: If the gas price is too high, the sender may want to cancel the transaction and resubmit it with a lower gas price to save on transaction fees.

# Related Methods

Here are the methods related to `cancelPrivateTransaction`:

* [sendPrivateTransaction](/reference/sendprivatetransaction-sdk): Used to send a single transaction to Flashbots. Flashbots will attempt to send the transaction to miners for the next 25 blocks.
