# Description

Returns the value of the provided position at the provided address, at the provided block in `Bytes32` format.

# Parameters

| Parameter       | Type      | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `addressOrName` | `string`  | The address or ENS name of the account to get the code for.                                 |
| `position`      | `integer` | The position of the storage slot to get.                                                    |
| `blockTag`      | `string`  | The optional block number or hash to get the code for. Defaults to 'latest' if unspecified. |

### `blockTag` parameters

* `pending` - A sample next block built by the client on top of `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from `local` mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
* `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
* `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is “unlikely” to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Goerli**.
* `finalized `- The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Goerli.**
* `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

| `Promise<string>` | `string` | Returns the value at this storage position. |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getStorageAt` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getStorageAt.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Initialize variables for the parameters
      let address = "registrar.firefly.eth"
      let position =  0
      
      //Call the method to get storage
      let response = await alchemy.core.getStorageAt(address, position)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  0x000000000000000000000000314159265dd8dbb310642f98f50c066173c1259b
  ```
