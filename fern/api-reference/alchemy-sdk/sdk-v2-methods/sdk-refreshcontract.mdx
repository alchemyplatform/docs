Triggers a metadata refresh of all NFTs in the provided contract address. This method is useful after an NFT collection is revealed.

Refreshes are queued on the Alchemy backend and may take time to fully process. To refresh the metadata for a specific token, use the [refreshNftMetadata](/reference/sdk-refreshnftmetadata) method instead.

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      // define the contract address
      const address = "0x5180db8F5c931aaE63c74266b211F580155ecac8";

      //Call the method to return the refresh result response object
      const response = await alchemy.nft.refreshContract(address)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  }

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  {
    contractAddress: '0x5180db8f5c931aae63c74266b211f580155ecac8',
    refreshState: 'queued',
    progress: 0
  }

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `refreshContract` method:

* **Marketplace management**: NFT marketplaces can use the `refreshContract` method to ensure that the data for a specific contract is up-to-date, including any changes to the contract's metadata or events. This information is crucial for ensuring that the marketplace accurately reflects the current state of the contract.

* **Contract management**: Developers can use the `refreshContract` method to update the data for a contract they are developing. This can be useful for ensuring that the contract is functioning properly and for identifying any potential issues or bugs.

* **User interface updates**: DApp developers can use the `refreshContract` method to update their user interfaces to reflect any changes to the contract's metadata or events. This can be useful for improving the user experience and ensuring that the DApp is always displaying the most accurate information.
