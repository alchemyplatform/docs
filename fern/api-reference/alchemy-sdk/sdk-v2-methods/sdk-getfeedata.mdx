Returns the recommended fee data to use in a transaction. For an EIP-1559 transaction, the `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` should be used.

For legacy transactions and networks which do not support EIP-1559, the `gasPrice` should be used.

# Description

Returns the recommended fee data to use in a transaction. For an EIP-1559 transaction, the `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` should be used.

For legacy transactions and networks which do not support EIP-1559, the `gasPrice` should be used.

| `maxFeePerGas`         | `number / string` | `BigNumber` - The `maxFeePerGas` to use for a transaction. This is based on the most recent block's baseFee.                                  |
| `maxPriorityFeePerGas` | `number / string` | `BigNumber` - The `maxPriorityFeePerGas` to use for a transaction. This accounts for the uncle risk and for the majority of current MEV risk. |
| `gasPrice`             | `number / string` | `BigNumber` - The `gasPrice` to use for legacy transactions or networks which do not support EIP-1559.                                        |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getFeeData` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getfeedata.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {

      //Call the method to return the recommended fee data to use in a transaction.
      let response = await alchemy.core.getFeeData()

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  {
    lastBaseFeePerGas: BigNumber { _hex: '0x0d9fbc42bf', _isBigNumber: true },
    maxFeePerGas: BigNumber { _hex: '0x1b98e0b47e', _isBigNumber: true },
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: BigNumber { _hex: '0x59682f00', _isBigNumber: true },
    gasPrice: BigNumber { _hex: '0x0da39585ec', _isBigNumber: true }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Use Cases

Here are some possible use cases for the `getFeeData` method:

* **Transaction fee estimation**: Developers can use the `getFeeData` method to estimate the fee required for a particular transaction. This information can be used to determine the optimal fee to set for a transaction, given the current network conditions.

* **Gas price monitoring**: The `getFeeData` method can be used to monitor changes in the gas price of a blockchain network over time. This information can be used to adjust gas price strategies for applications, ensuring they stay competitive and cost-effective.

* **Smart contract development**: When developing smart contracts, developers need to ensure that their contracts operate within the gas limits of the network. The `getFeeData` method can be used to calculate the gas costs associated with specific operations, helping developers to optimize their contract code and stay within network constraints.
