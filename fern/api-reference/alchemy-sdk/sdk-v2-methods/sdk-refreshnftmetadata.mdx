# Description

Refreshes the cached metadata for a provided NFT contract address and token id. Returns a boolean value indicating whether the metadata was refreshed.

This method is useful when you want to refresh the metadata for an NFT that has been updated since the last time it was fetched.

<Info>
  Note that the backend only allows one refresh per token every 15 minutes, globally for all users. The last refresh time for an NFT can be accessed on the `Nft.timeLastUpdated` field.
</Info>

To trigger a refresh for all NFTs in a contract, use [refreshContract](/reference/refreshcontract-sdk) instead.
