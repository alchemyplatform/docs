## Code Sandbox

You can test out the `simulateAssetChangesBundle` method using the code sandbox below:

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `simulateAssetChangesBundle` method:

* **Testing**: Developers can use `simulateAssetChangesBundle` to test their smart contracts before deploying them to a blockchain network. By simulating the changes that would occur, developers can identify potential errors and debug their code.

* **Optimizing asset transactions**: Businesses that regularly perform asset transactions, such as banks or trading firms, can use `simulateAssetChangesBundle` to optimize their transaction strategies. By simulating different transactions scenarios, these firms can identify the most efficient ways to move assets between accounts.
