# Description

Returns the best guess of the current gas price to use in a transaction.

# Response

| Property             | Type     | Description                                                                         |

| `Promise<BigNumber>` | `object` | `BigNumber` Returns an object with the `_hex`: *string* and `_isBigNumber`: boolean |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getGasPrice` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getgasprice.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {

      //Call the method
      let response = await alchemy.core.getGasPrice()

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  BigNumber { _hex: '0x05813ed1b5', _isBigNumber: true }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Code Sandbox

You can test out the `getGasPrice` method using the code sandbox below:

# Use Cases

Here are some possible use cases for the `getGasPrice` method:

* **Gas estimation**: Before submitting a transaction to the EVM networks, it's important to estimate the amount of gas that will be required to execute the transaction. `getGasPrice` can be used to retrieve the current gas price and use it to estimate the gas cost of a transaction.

* **Gas price optimization**: Gas prices on the EVM networks can vary widely depending on network congestion and other factors. By using `getGasPrice`, developers can dynamically adjust the gas price of their transactions to optimize for speed and cost.

* **Gas price monitoring**: Gas prices can fluctuate rapidly, and it's important to stay up-to-date on the current market conditions. `getGasPrice` can be used to monitor gas prices and alert developers when prices are high or low.

* **Network analysis**: Gas prices can be an important indicator of network health and congestion. By analyzing historical gas prices using `getGasPrice`, developers can gain insights into network usage patterns and identify potential bottlenecks or congestion points.
