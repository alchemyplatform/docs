# Description

Returns an array of logs that match the provided filter.

# Parameters

| Name     | Type     | Description                                                           |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filter` | `object` | The filter object to use. Includes the `fromBlock` and the `toBlock`. |

### `filter` parameters

| Parameter   | Type     | Description                                                                           |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fromBlock` | `string` | Either the hex value of a **block number** OR One of the **block tags** listed below. |
| `toBlock`   | `string` | Either the hex value of a **block number** OR One of the **block tags** listed below: |

* `pending` (Not available on Ethereum) - A sample next block built by the client on top of `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from `local` mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
* `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
* `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is “unlikely” to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Goerli**.
* `finalized `- The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Goerli.**
* `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

# Response

| Property              | Type    | Description                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Promise<Array<Log>>` | `array` | `Array of log objects`, or an empty array if nothing has changed since the last poll. |

### `<Array<Log>>` response object parameters

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getLogs` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getlogs.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Initialize variables for the parameters
      let address = "0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7"
      let topics =  [ "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef" ]
      let blockHash = "0x49664d1de6b3915d7e6fa297ff4b3d1c5328b8ecf2ff0eefb912a4dc5f6ad4a0"
      
      //Call the method to return array of logs
      let response = await alchemy.core.getLogs(address, topics, blockHash)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```

# Use Cases

Here are some possible use cases for the `getLogs` method:

* **Event tracking**: `getLogs` can be used to track specific events generated by smart contracts. This is useful for monitoring the state changes of a smart contract and taking action based on those changes.

* **Analytics**: `getLogs` can be used to analyze smart contract data and generate reports or visualizations. For example, you could use `getLogs` to analyze the frequency and volume of trades on a decentralized exchange.

* **Debugging**: `getLogs` can be used to debug smart contracts. If a smart contract is not behaving as expected, you can use `getLogs` to retrieve the events generated by the contract and identify where the issue is occurring.

# Related Methods
