# Description

Returns the block number of the most recently mined block.

# Response

| Property          | Type     | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Promise<number>` | `number` | Integer of the current block number the client is on. |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getBlockNumber` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getblocknumber.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
    	//The response returns the block number of the most recently mined block
      let response = await alchemy.core.getBlockNumber()

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  16698044
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `getBlockNumber` method:

* **Monitoring**: You can use `getBlockNumber` to monitor the progress of the Ethereum network by checking the current block number. This can be useful for tracking the growth of the network and understanding how it is evolving over time.

* **Smart Contract Development**: If you are developing a smart contract, you may need to know the current block number for certain operations, such as setting timeouts or scheduling transactions. You can use `getBlockNumber` to get the current block number and use it in your contract logic.
