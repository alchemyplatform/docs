# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make an `isContractAddress` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript isContractAddress.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "demo", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      const result = await alchemy.core.isContractAddress("0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"); // Wrapped ETH address

      // Logging the response to the console
      console.log(result)
  }

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  true
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for the `isContractAddress` method:

* **Verifying the contract status of an address**: It's important to know the type of an address (Externally Owned Address or Contract Address) in many blockchain related operations. This function allows developers to verify if an address is a smart contract.

* **Improving security**: Before interacting with an address, verifying its type can add an extra layer of security to prevent potential exploits ( for example, reentrancy attacks ) or mistakes.

# Related Methods
