# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `getSpamContracts` method:

* **Anti-spam measures**: `getSpamContracts` could be used to identify and flag contracts or agreements that are likely to be spam or fraudulent. For example, a system could use machine learning algorithms to analyze contracts and agreements for patterns and characteristics commonly associated with spam or fraudulent activity.

* **Contract management**: `getSpamContracts` could be used as a tool to manage and organize a large number of contracts or agreements. By identifying contracts that are unlikely to be legitimate, the system could prioritize the review and processing of valid contracts.

* **Legal compliance**: `getSpamContracts` could be used as part of a compliance process to ensure that all contracts and agreements meet legal and regulatory requirements. By identifying potential spam or fraudulent contracts, the system could prevent violations of legal and regulatory frameworks.
