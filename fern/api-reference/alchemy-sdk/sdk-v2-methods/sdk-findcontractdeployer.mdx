# Description

Finds the address that deployed the provided contract and the block number it was deployed in.

<Info>
  This method performs a binary search across all blocks since genesis and can take a long time to complete. This method is a convenience method that will eventually be replaced by a single call to an Alchemy endpoint with this information cached.

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `findContractDeployer` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript findContractDeployer.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Assign the contract address to a variable
      let address = "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"

      //The response fetches the contract deployer of the above address
      let response = await alchemy.core.findContractDeployer(address)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

And here is an example of what a successful response to this request might look like:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell response
  {
    deployerAddress: '0xaba7161a7fb69c88e16ed9f455ce62b791ee4d03',
    blockNumber: 12287507
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for `findContractDeployer` method:

* **Contract verification**: When a new contract is deployed on a blockchain, it is important to verify the identity of the deployer to ensure that the contract was deployed by a trusted source. By using the `findContractDeployer` method, developers can easily verify the deployer of a contract and ensure that the contract is legitimate.

* **Security auditing**: Security auditors can use the `findContractDeployer` method to identify potential security vulnerabilities in a smart contract by analyzing the behavior of the deployer. If the deployer is identified as a potential threat, additional security measures can be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the contract.

* **Contract management**: Smart contracts are often used to automate business processes and manage digital assets. By using the `findContractDeployer` method, contract managers can identify who has deployed a particular contract and ensure that it is being used in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon by all parties.
