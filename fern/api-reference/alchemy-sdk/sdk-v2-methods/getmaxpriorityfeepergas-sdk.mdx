# Description

Returns a fee per gas (in `wei`) that is an estimate of how much you can pay as a priority fee, or "tip", to get a transaction included in the current block.

This number is generally used to set the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` field in a transaction request.

# Response

| Property          | Type     | Description              |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| `Promise<number>` | `number` | Returns the fee per gas. |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Call the method to display the max priority fee per gas in wei
      const response = await alchemy.transact.getMaxPriorityFeePerGas()

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  }

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` method:

* **Setting optimal gas fees for transactions**: By using the `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` method, developers can ensure that they are setting optimal gas fees for their transactions. This can help to ensure that transactions are processed quickly and efficiently, while also minimizing costs for users.
* **Automating gas fee calculations**: Some applications may need to automatically calculate gas fees for transactions. By using the `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` method, developers can automate this process and ensure that gas fees are always set at the optimal level.
* **Monitoring network congestion**: The value returned by `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` can be an indicator of network congestion. Developers can use this information to monitor the health of the network and adjust their gas fees accordingly.
* **Providing transparency to users**: By displaying the current `getMaxPriorityFeePerGas` value to users, developers can provide transparency and help users make informed decisions about their transactions.
