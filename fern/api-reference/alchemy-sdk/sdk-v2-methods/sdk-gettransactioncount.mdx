# Description

Returns the number of transactions ever sent from the provided address, as of the provided block tag. This value is used as the nonce for the next transaction from the address sent to the network.

# Parameters

| Name            | Type     | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `addressOrName` | `string` | The address or ENS name of the account to get the nonce for.            |
| `blockTag`      | `string` | The optional block number or hash. Defaults to 'latest' if unspecified. |

### `blockTag` parameters

* `pending` - A sample next block built by the client on top of `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from `local` mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
* `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
* `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is “unlikely” to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Goerli**.
* `finalized `- The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Goerli.**
* `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

# Response

| Property          | Type     | Description                     |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Promise<number>` | `number` | Returns the value of the count. |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getTransactionCount` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getTransactionCount.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Initialize variables for the parameters
      const address = "vitalik.eth"
      
      //Call the method
      let response = await alchemy.core.getTransactionCount(address)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  1017
  ```
</CodeGroup>
