# Description

Returns the block from the network based on the provided block number or hash. Transactions on the block are represented as an array of transaction hashes. To get the full transaction details on the block, use [getBlockWithTransactions](/reference/sdk-getblockwithtransactions) instead.

# Parameters

| Name                  | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `blockHashOrBlockTag` | `string` | The block hash or one of the following block tags: - `pending`: A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of this as block that have not been mined yet. - `latest`: The most recent block in the chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the chain even under normal conditions. - `earliest`: The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created. |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getBlock` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getblock.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
    apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
    // using the block tag "latest" to get the latest block 
    // could've used a block hash to get a particualr block as well
    let blockTagOrHash = "latest"

    // calling the getBlock method to get the latest block
    let response = await alchemy.core.getBlock(blockTagOrHash);

    // logging the response to the console
    console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>
