# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network, Wallet, Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");
  const dotenv = require("dotenv");
  dotenv.config();

  //Replace with your own private key
  const {PRIVATE_KEY} = process.env;

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);
  const wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY);

  const main = async () => {
      // define the transaction
      const transaction = {
          to: "0xa238b6008Bc2FBd9E386A5d4784511980cE504Cd",

          maxFeePerGas: Utils.parseUnits("20", "gwei"),
          nonce: await alchemy.core.getTransactionCount(wallet.getAddress()),
          type: 2,
          chainId: 5, // Corresponds to ETH_GOERLI
        };

      const rawTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);
      const response = await alchemy.transact.sendTransaction(rawTransaction)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  }

  main();

# Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for the `sendTransaction` method:

* **Sending ETH**: `sendTransaction` can be used to send Ether from one Ethereum address to another. This is one of the most common use cases for sendTransaction.

* **Deploying a smart contract**: When you deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain, you need to send a transaction that includes the bytecode of the contract. `sendTransaction` can be used to send this transaction.

* **Interacting with a smart contract**: Once a smart contract has been deployed, you can interact with it by sending transactions that call its functions. `sendTransaction` can be used to send these transactions.

* **Token transfers**: Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain are often built using smart contracts. `sendTransaction` can be used to transfer tokens from one Ethereum address to another.

# Related Methods

Here are the methods related to `sendTransaction`:

* [sendPrivateTransaction](/reference/sendprivatetransaction-sdk): Used to send a single transaction to Flashbots. Flashbots will attempt to send the transaction to miners for the next 25 blocks.
