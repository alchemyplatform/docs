# Description

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make an `estimateGas` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript estimateGas.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network, Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      //Define the params object
      const params = {
          // Wrapped ETH address
          to: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
          // `function deposit() payable`
          data: "0xd0e30db0",
          // 1 ether
          value: Utils.parseEther("1.0"),
      };

      //The response returns the block number of the most recently mined block
      let response = await alchemy.transact.estimateGas(params)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
      "type": "BigNumber",
      "hex": "0x6d22"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup> 

# Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for the `estimateGas` method:

* **Optimizing transaction fees**: Gas is the fee paid by the sender of a transaction to compensate the miners for processing it. By estimating the gas required for a transaction beforehand, developers can optimize their transaction fees by choosing the right gas price and limit.

* **Ensuring successful transactions**: If a transaction runs out of gas before it is completed, it will fail and the sender will lose the gas spent on it. By estimating the required gas beforehand, developers can ensure that the transaction has enough gas to complete successfully.

* **Validating transaction parameters**: When submitting a transaction, certain parameters such as the gas limit and gas price must be set correctly to avoid issues such as network congestion or excessive fees. By using `estimateGas`, developers can validate these parameters before submitting the transaction.

* [getTransaction](/reference/getTransaction-sdktransaction): Returns the transaction details.
* [getMaxPriorityFeePerGas](/reference/getmaxpriorityfeepergas-sdk): Returns a fee per gas (in wei) that is an estimate of how much you can pay as a priority fee, or "tip", to get a transaction included in the current block.
