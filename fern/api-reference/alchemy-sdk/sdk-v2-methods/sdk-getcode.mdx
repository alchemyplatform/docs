# Description

Returns the contract code of the provided address at the block. If there is no contract deployed, the result is `0x`.

# Parameters

| Name            | Type     | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `addressOrName` | `string` | The address or ENS name of the account to get the code for.             |
| `blockTag`      | `string` | The optional block number or hash. Defaults to `latest` if unspecified. |

### `blockTag` parameters

* `pending` - A sample next block built by the client on top of `latest` and containing the set of transactions usually taken from `local` mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
* `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
* `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is “unlikely” to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Goerli**.
* `finalized `- The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Goerli.**
* `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

# Response

| Property          | Type     | Description       |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| `Promise<string>` | `string` | Returns the code. |

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk
  ```

  ```shell yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `getCode` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript getcode.js
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
      apiKey: "alchemy-replit", // Replace with your API key
      network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  const main = async () => {
      let address = "registrar.firefly.eth"

      //Call the method to retrieve code of address
      let response = await alchemy.core.getCode(address)

      //Logging the response to the console
      console.log(response)
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  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

# Use Cases

The everyday use case for the `getCode` method is to return the contract code of an address on the blockchain. However, here are some other possible use cases for the `getCode` method:

* **Contract verification**: Developers can use the `getCode` method to verify that the bytecode of a deployed contract matches the expected bytecode. This can be used to ensure that a contract has not been tampered with or to verify that a contract has been deployed correctly.

* **Contract debugging**: If a contract is not behaving as expected, developers can use `getCode` to retrieve the bytecode and examine it for errors or unexpected behavior.

* **Contract analysis**: Researchers or security auditors might use `getCode` to analyze the bytecode of a contract for vulnerabilities or other issues.

* **Contract migration**: If a contract needs to be migrated to a new address, developers can use `getCode` to retrieve the bytecode of the existing contract and then deploy it to the new address.

Overall, `getCode` is a useful tool for developers who are building on the EVM networks and need to interact with deployed contracts. It can be used for a variety of purposes, from debugging and analysis to migration and verification.
