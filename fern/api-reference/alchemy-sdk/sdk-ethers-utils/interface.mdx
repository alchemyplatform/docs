Learn about the `Interface` utils method

# Introduction

The [`Interace`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/abi/interface/#Interface--creating) method generates a smart contract interface from a JSON ABI.

# Usage

The interface method is useful when you want to create an instance of a smart contract and call its methods.

Here's an example code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Javascript
  const { Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  let abi = [
    {
      constant: true,
      inputs: [],
      name: "get",
      outputs: [
        {
          name: "",
          type: "uint256",
        },
      ],
      payable: false,
      stateMutability: "view",
      type: "function",
    },
  ];

  let contractInterface = new Utils.Interface(abi);
  console.log(contractInterface);

  /*
  Output: 

  Interface {
    fragments: [
      FunctionFragment {
        type: 'function',
        name: 'get',
        constant: true,
        inputs: [],
        outputs: [Array],
        payable: false,
        stateMutability: 'view',
        gas: null,
        _isFragment: true
      }
    ],
    _abiCoder: AbiCoder { coerceFunc: null },
    functions: {
      'get()': FunctionFragment {
        type: 'function',
        name: 'get',
        constant: true,
        inputs: [],
        outputs: [Array],
        payable: false,
        stateMutability: 'view',
        gas: null,
        _isFragment: true
      }
    },
    errors: {},
    events: {},
    structs: {},
    deploy: ConstructorFragment {
      name: null,
      type: 'constructor',
      inputs: [],
      payable: false,
      stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
      gas: null,
      _isFragment: true
    },
    _isInterface: true
  }
  */
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The code creates an ABI as an array of JSON objects, where each object represents a single function of the smart contract. In this example, the ABI has only one function named "get".

The `contractInterface` object is created by calling the `Interface` method and passing in the ABI array. The output of the `console.log` statement shows that the `contractInterface` object contains several properties:

* `fragments`: an array of the individual functions and constructors in the smart contract.

* `functions`: an object where each key is the encoded function signature and the value is a `FunctionFragment` object that describes the function.

* `events`: an object where each key is the event signature and the value is an `EventFragment` object that describes the event.

* `structs`: an object where each key is the type signature of a struct and the value is a `StructFragment` object that describes the struct.

* `deploy`: a `ConstructorFragment` object that describes the constructor function of the smart contract.

* `_abiCoder`: an `AbiCoder` object that is used for encoding and decoding smart contract data.

* `errors`: an object that contains error messages if any occurred during the creation of the contract interface.

* `_isInterface`: a Boolean that indicates if this object is an instance of Interface.
