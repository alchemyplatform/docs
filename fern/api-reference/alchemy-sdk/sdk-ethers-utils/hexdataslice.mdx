Learn about the `hexDataSlice` utils method

# Introduction

The [`hexDataSlice`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/bytes/#utils-hexDataSlice) method is used to extract a portion of a hex string. This method is often used to extract specific values from hex strings for EVM operations.

# Usage

This method should be used when extracting a portion of a hex string. For example, you can use this method to extract a portion of the hex string `'0x68656c6c6f20776f726c64'` from position 2 with length 4. The result would be `'0x6c6c'`.

Here's a simple code example to demonstrate how to use this method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Javascript
  const { Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  let hexString = "0x68656c6c6f20776f726c64";
  let slicedHex = Utils.hexDataSlice(hexString, 2, 4); 
  console.log(slicedHex); // 0x6c6c
  ```
</CodeGroup>
