Learn about the `hexlify` utils method

# Introduction

The [`hexlify`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/bytes/#utils-hexlify) method provides the ability to convert a given value to its hexadecimal representation. This method takes an input value and returns the hexadecimal representation of the value.

# Usage

This method is useful for converting values to their hexadecimal representation, which is a more compact representation and can be easily used in EVM transactions and smart contracts. The input value can be of any data type, including strings, integers, and arrays.

Here is an example of using the `hexlify` method with the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Javascript
  const { Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  let value = 123;

  let hexValue = Utils.hexlify(value);
  console.log(hexValue); // 0x7b (0x7b is the hex representation of 123)
  ```
</CodeGroup>
