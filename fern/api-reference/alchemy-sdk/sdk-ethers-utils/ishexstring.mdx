Learn about the `isHexString` utils method

# Introduction

The [`isHexString`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/bytes/#utils-isHexString) method is used to check if a string is a hex string. This method is often used to validate if a string is a valid hex string for EVM operations.

# Usage

This method should be used when checking if a string is a hex string. For example, you can use this method to check if the string `'0xabcdef'` is a hex string. The result would be `true`.

Here's a simple code example to demonstrate how to use this method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Javascript
  const { Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  let string = "0xabcdef";
  let isHex = Utils.isHexString(string); 
  console.log(isHex); // true
  ```
</CodeGroup>
