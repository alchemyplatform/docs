Learn about the `hexStripZeros` utils method

# Introduction

The [`hexStripZeros`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/bytes/#utils-hexStripZeros) method is used to remove leading zeros from a hex string. This method is often used to clean up hex strings for EVM operations.

# Usage

This method should be used when removing leading zeros from a hex string. For example, you can use this method to remove the leading zeros from the hex string `'0x0000000000000000000001'`. The result would be `'0x1'`.

Here's a simple code example to demonstrate how to use this method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Javascript
  const { Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  let hexString = "0x0000000000000000000001";
  let strippedHex = Utils.hexStripZeros(hexString); 
  console.log(strippedHex); // 0x1
  ```
</CodeGroup>
