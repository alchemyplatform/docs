Learn about the `hexConcat` utils method

# Introduction

The [`hexConcat`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/bytes/#utils-hexConcat) method is used to concatenate multiple hex strings into a single hex string. This method is often used to join together several hex values into a single string for EVM operations.

# Usage

This method should be used when concatenating multiple hex strings into a single string. For example, if you have two hex strings `'0xabcd'` and `'0xef01'`, you can use this method to join them into a single string `'0xabcdef01'`.

Here's a simple code example to demonstrate how to use this method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Javascript
  const { Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  let hexString1 = "0xabcd";
  let hexString2 = "0xef01";

  let concatenatedHex = Utils.hexConcat([hexString1, hexString2]);
  console.log(concatenatedHex); // 0xabcdef01
  ```
</CodeGroup>
