Learn about the `hexDataLength` utils method

# Introduction

The [`hexDataLength`](https://docs.ethers.org/v4/api-utils.html) method is used to determine the length of a hex string in bytes. This method is often used to ensure that hex strings are the correct length for EVM operations.

# Usage

This method should be used when determining the length of a hex string in bytes. For example, you can use this method to determine that a hex string `'0x68656c6c6f20776f726c64'` has a length of 11 bytes.

Here's a simple code example to demonstrate how to use this method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Javascript
  const { Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  let hexString = "0x68656c6c6f20776f726c64";
  let hexLength = Utils.hexDataLength(hexString); 
  console.log(hexLength); // 11
  ```
</CodeGroup>
