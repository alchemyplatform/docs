Learn about the `hexZeroPad` utils method

# Introduction

The [`hexZeroPad`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/bytes/#utils-hexZeroPad) method is used to pad a hex string with leading zeros so that its length is equal to a specified number of characters.

# Usage

This method should be used when you want to pad a hex string with leading zeros so that its length is equal to a specified number of characters. For example, you can use this method to pad the hex string '0x1234' so that its length is equal to 8 characters (or 4 bytes).

Here's a simple code example to demonstrate how to use this method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Javascript
  const { Utils } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  let hexString = '0x1234';

  let zeroPaddedHexString = Utils.hexZeroPad(hexString, 4); // 4 bytes = 8 characters 
  console.log(zeroPaddedHexString); // '0x00001234'
  ```
</CodeGroup>
