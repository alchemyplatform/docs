# Introduction

The Alchemy SDK Debug Methods allow for tracing and debugging of calls, blocks, and transactions for improved troubleshooting and analysis.

# Supported Methods

| Method                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [`traceCall`](/reference/sdk-tracecall)               | Runs an `eth_call` with the context of the provided block execution using the final state of the parent block as the base.                                                                                                                                              |
| [`traceTransaction`](/reference/sdk-tracetransaction) | Attempts to run the transaction in the exact same manner as it was executed on the network. It will replay any transaction that may have been executed prior to this one before it and will then attempt to execute the transaction that corresponds to the given hash. |
| [`traceBlock`](/reference/sdk-traceblock)             | Replays a block that has already been mined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
