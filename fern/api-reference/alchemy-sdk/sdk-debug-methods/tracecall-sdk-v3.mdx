`traceCall`runs an [`eth_call`](/reference/eth-call) with the context of the provided block execution using the final state of the parent block as the base.

# Example Request and Response

**Prerequisite**: You will need to install the Alchemy SDK before making requests with it.

The commands for installing it using **npm** or **yarn** are given below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm
  npm install alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```

  ```text yarn
  yarn add alchemy-sdk@latest
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Request

Here is an example of how to make a `traceCall` request using the Alchemy SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript traceCall response
  // Imports the Alchemy SDK
  const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

  // Configures the Alchemy SDK
  const config = {
    apiKey: "demo", // Replace with your API key
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network
  };

  // Creates an Alchemy object instance with the config to use for making requests
  const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

  // Example of using the traceCall method
  const main = async () => {
    // The transaction to debug trace.
    let transaction = {
      from: "0x6f1FB6EFDf50F34bFA3F2bC0E5576EdD71631638",
      to: "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f",
      value: "0x0",
      data: "0x70a082310000000000000000000000006E0d01A76C3Cf4288372a29124A26D4353EE51BE",
    };

    // The block to debug the transaction in.
    let block = "latest";

    // Tracer type and configuration.
    let tracerConfig = {
      type: "callTracer",
      onlyTopCall: true,
    };

    // Calling the traceCall method
    let response = await alchemy.debug.traceCall(
      transaction,
      block,
      tracerConfig
    );

    // Logging the response to the console
    console.log(response);
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response

And here is an example of what a successful response to this request might look like:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json sendTransaction Response
  {
      "from": "0x6f1fb6efdf50f34bfa3f2bc0e5576edd71631638",
      "gas": "0x7fffffffffffffff",
      "gasUsed": "0x5de2",
      "to": "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f",
      "input": "0x70a082310000000000000000000000006e0d01a76c3cf4288372a29124a26d4353ee51be",
      "output": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000858898f93629000",
      "value": "0x0",
      "type": "CALL"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Code Sandbox

You can test the `traceCall` method using the code sandbox below:

# Use Cases

Some of the use cases for `traceCall` are:

* **Debugging Contract Issues**: Developers can use the `traceCall` method to diagnose and fix issues with smart contract execution by tracing the flow of execution and the state changes made by the contract.

* **Optimizing Contract Performance**: Developers can use the `traceCall` method to identify and optimize slow or inefficient sections of code by tracing the execution and gas consumption of smart contract calls.

* **Verifying Contract Security**: Security auditors can use the `traceCall` method to verify the security of smart contracts by tracing the execution of malicious inputs and evaluating the contract's response.

* **Improving Contract User Experience**: Developers can use the `traceCall` method to improve the user experience of smart contract interactions by tracing the execution of user inputs and evaluating the contract's response.

# Related Methods

Here are the methods related to `traceCall`:

* [`traceTransaction`](/reference/sdk-tracetransaction): Attempts to run the transaction in the exact same manner as it was executed on the network. It will replay any transaction that may have been executed prior to this one before it and will then attempt to execute the transaction that corresponds to the given hash.
* [`traceBlock`](/reference/sdk-traceblock): Replays a block that has already been mined.
