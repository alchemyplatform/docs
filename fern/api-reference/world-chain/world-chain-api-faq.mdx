## What is World Chain?

World Chain is a blockchain designed for humans, developed by World. It aims to accelerate the adoption of Proof of Personhood and decentralized finance in the age of AI. World Chain provides a platform where verified humans get priority blockspace over bots and a gas allowance for casual transactions, creating an ecosystem focused on utility for everyday life.

## What is the World Chain API?

The World Chain API allows developers to interact with the World Chain network through a set of JSON-RPC methods. It supports various operations such as smart contract deployment, transaction processing, and data retrieval, enabling developers to integrate World Chain's functionality into their applications.

## How can I get started using the World Chain API?

Explained in [World Chain API Quickstart](/reference/worldchain-api-quickstart).

## Is World Chain EVM compatible?

Yes, World Chain is EVM-compatible. As an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, it allows developers to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts and applications on the World Chain network, leveraging existing Ethereum development tools and practices.

## What API does World Chain use?

World Chain utilizes the JSON-RPC API standard, which is widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem. This provides a familiar and efficient interface for blockchain interactions.

## What is a World Chain API key?

When accessing the World Chain network via a service provider, developers need an API key to send transactions and retrieve data. An API key ensures secure and authenticated access to the network.

## Which libraries support World Chain?

As an EVM-compatible blockchain, World Chain supports popular Ethereum libraries such as Web3.js and Ethers.js. This allows developers to leverage existing tools and knowledge when building on World Chain.

## How does World Chain prioritize human users?

World Chain uses World ID's Proof of Personhood system to verify human users. Verified humans receive priority blockspace and a gas allowance for transactions. This verification is optional and anonymized through zero-knowledge proofs.
