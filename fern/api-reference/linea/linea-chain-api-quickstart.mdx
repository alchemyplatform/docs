\_To use the Linea Chain API you'll need to [create a free Alchemy account](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=summer) first. Also, we're offering up to $20,000 to help you start building. It's easy to qualify. Learn more [here](https://www.alchemy.com/summer-of-chains-build-and-save)!\_

## Introduction

Linea is an EVM-compatible blockchain designed to provide scalability and efficiency for decentralized applications (dApps). Known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, Linea offers a robust environment for deploying Ethereum-based applications.

***

## What is the Linea Chain API?

The Linea Chain API facilitates interaction with the Linea network through a collection of JSON-RPC methods. Given its compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem, developers familiar with Ethereum's JSON-RPC APIs will find working with Linea both intuitive and straightforward.

## Getting Started Instructions

### 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Your first step involves selecting a package manager, which will be crucial for managing your project's dependencies. The choice between `npm` and `yarn` depends on your personal preference or project requirements.

| npm                                                                                                                       | yarn                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Begin with `npm` by following the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). | For `yarn`, refer to [yarn's installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). |

### 2. Set Up Your Project

To kickstart your project, open your terminal and execute the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text npm
  mkdir linea-api-quickstart
  cd linea-api-quickstart
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```text yarn
  mkdir linea-api-quickstart
  cd linea-api-quickstart
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a new directory named `linea-api-quickstart` and initializes a Node.js project within it.

### 3. Make Your First Request

For making API requests, we'll use Axios, a widely-used HTTP client. Install Axios with the following command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  npm install axios
  # Or with yarn
  # yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next, create an `index.js` file in your project directory. Paste the following code to send a request to the Linea network:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = `https://linea-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${yourAPIKey}`;

  const payload = {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'eth_blockNumber',
    params: []
  };

  axios.post(url, payload)
    .then(response => {
      console.log('Block Number:', response.data.result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember to replace `yourAPIKey` with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

### 4. Run Your Script

To execute your script and make a request to the Linea Chain, run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see the current block number on Linea Chain (in hexadecimal format) outputted to your console:

```shell
Block Number: 0x6d68e
```

## Next Steps

Well done! You've just made your first request to the Linea Chain API. With this foundation, you can dive deeper into the array of [JSON-RPC methods available on Linea Chain](/reference/linea-chain-api-endpoints) and start building your dApps on it!
