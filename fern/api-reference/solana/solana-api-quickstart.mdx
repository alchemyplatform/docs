# Getting Started Instructions

## 1. Choose a package manager (npm or yarn)

For this guide, we will be using npm or yarn as our package manager to install either `alchemy-sdk` or any other packages.

### npm

To get started with `npm`, follow the documentation to install Node.js and `npm` for your operating system: [https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### yarn

To get started with `yarn`, follow these steps: [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

## 2. Set up your project (npm or yarn)

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Shell (npm)
  mkdir alchemy-solana-api
  cd alchemy-solana-api
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```text Shell (yarn)
  mkdir alchemy-solana-api
  cd alchemy-solana-api
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Install Solana Web3.js Library

Run the following command to install the Solana Web3.js library with npm or yarn.

<CodeGroup>
  ```text npm
  npm install --save @solana/web3.js
  ```

  ```text yarn
  yarn add @solana/web3.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 4. Make your first request

You are all set now to use Solana API and make your first request. For instance, lets make a request to `get latest slot`. Create an `index.js` file and paste the following code snippet into the file.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript index.js
  const solanaWeb3 = require("@solana/web3.js");

  const main = async () => {
    rpc = "https://solana-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<Your-Alchemy-API-Key>"; // RPC URL for connecting with a Solana node
    connection = new solanaWeb3.Connection(rpc, "confirmed"); // confirming the connection

    let slot = await connection.getSlot(); // getting the most recent slot number
    console.log("The latest slot number is", slot); // logging the most recent slot number
  };

  main();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 5. Run script

To run the above node script, use cmd `node index.js`, and you should see the output.

<CodeGroup>
  ```text shell
  The latest slot number is 164150510
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Leverage Alchemy's AccountsDB Infrastructure for Solana RPC Requests!

The most expensive Solana RPC requests involve account scans, such as `getProgramAccounts` and `getLargestTokenAccounts`. These methods are incredibly useful but non-performant methods since they induce a heavy RPC load on Solana validator nodes, often resulting in a 5XX response due to timeout or a response with high latency.

Alchemy has built out core infrastructure that sits atop our Solana validator nodes to support these methods at scale, through what we call the AccountsDB Infrastructure. This infrastructure allows for **faster**, **scalable**, and more **reliable** responses to these methods by paginating the response with a `pageKey`. You could then loop through your that same request with at scan and aggregate the full response from our validator nodes.

You can see `pageKey` is now an optional parameter in each account-scanning method in our Solana [docs](/reference/getprogramaccounts), and you may also include an `order` optional parameter that would sort the accounts in the response by their `pubkey` field.

Here's an example with `getProgramAccounts`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  const axios = require("axios");

  async function getProgramAccountsExample() {
    let gPAExampleRequest = {
      method: "getProgramAccounts",
      params: [
        "ZETAxsqBRek56DhiGXrn75yj2NHU3aYUnxvHXpkf3aD",
        {
          encoding: "base64",
          withContext: true,
          order: "desc",
          dataSlice: {
            offset: 0,
            length: 10,
          },
        },
      ],
      id: 0,
      jsonrpc: "2.0",
    };
    let programAccounts = [];

    const alchemyRPCUrl =
      "https://solana-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR-API-KEY>";
    try {
      let response = await axios.post(alchemyRPCUrl, gPAExampleRequest);
      let responseData = response.data["result"];

      // continue aggregating if there's a new pageKey present in the latest response
      while (responseData["pageKey"]) {
        programAccounts = programAccounts.concat(responseData["value"]);

        // place the pagekey within the optional config object
        // (you may need to create that config object if you didn't have it originally)
        gPAExampleRequest["params"][1]["pageKey"] = responseData["pageKey"];

        // make another call to getProgramAccounts with the pageKey
        response = await axios.post(alchemyRPCUrl, gPAExampleRequest);
        responseData = response.data["result"];
      }

      programAccounts = programAccounts.concat(responseData["value"]);
      console.log(programAccounts);
      return programAccounts;
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err.message);
      return [];
    }
  }
  ```
