## What is Solana

Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed to support the scale, open participation, and performance required to power the next generation of decentralized applications. It is built on a new consensus algorithm called Proof of History (PoH) which allows it to process up to 50,000 transactions per second. Solana also features a unique architecture that allows for low-latency transactions, low transaction fees, and a high degree of decentralization.

## What is the Solana API

The Solana API allows decentralized applications to connect to a Solana node that is part of the Solana blockchain. Developers can interact with on-chain data, send transactions, and deploy contracts by leveraging Alchemy's API endpoints. The API follows a JSON-RPC standard, a lightweight, remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that is commonly used when interacting with blockchain data.

## How can I get started using the Solana API?

Explained in the [Solana API Quickstart Guide](/reference/solana-api-quickstart#getting-started-instructions).

## What methods does Alchemy support for the Solana API?

You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy support for the Solana API on the [Solana API Endpoints](/reference/solana-api-endpoints) page.
