## Introduction

Shape is a chain for creators built on top of Ethereum. It's an open space where everyone is free to create, from fine art to experimental projects, fostering a unique cultural ecosystem. Shape offers creators the opportunity to claim back 80% of sequencer fees users spend interacting with their contracts, making it an attractive platform for innovative content creation.

## What is the Shape API?

The Shape API allows interaction with the Shape network through a set of JSON-RPC methods. Its design is familiar to developers who have worked with Ethereum's JSON-RPC APIs, making it intuitive and straightforward to use.

## Getting Started Instructions

### 1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)

Select a package manager to manage your project's dependencies. Choose between `npm` and `yarn` based on your preference or project requirements.

| npm                                                                                                                       | yarn                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Begin with `npm` by following the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). | For `yarn`, refer to [yarn's installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). |

### 2. Set Up Your Project

Open your terminal and execute the following commands to create and initialize your project:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text npm
  mkdir shape-api-quickstart
  cd shape-api-quickstart
  npm init --yes
  ```

  ```text yarn
  mkdir shape-api-quickstart
  cd shape-api-quickstart
  yarn init --yes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a new directory named `shape-api-quickstart` and initializes a Node.js project within it.

### 3. Make Your First Request

Install Axios, a popular HTTP client, to make API requests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  npm install axios
  # Or with yarn
  # yarn add axios
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and paste the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = `https://shape-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${yourAPIKey}`;

  const payload = {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'eth_blockNumber',
    params: []
  };

  axios.post(url, payload)
    .then(response => {
      console.log('Latest Block:', response.data.result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Run Your Script

Execute your script to make a request to the Shape mainnet:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should see the latest block information from Shape's mainnet outputted to your console:

```shell
Latest Block: 0x...
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've made your first request to the Shape API on the mainnet. You can now explore the various [JSON-RPC methods available on Shape](/reference/shape-api-endpoints) and start building your creative projects on this innovative platform.
