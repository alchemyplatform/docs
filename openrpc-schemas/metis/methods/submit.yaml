- name: eth_sendRawTransaction
  summary: Submits a raw transaction to the network.
  description: |
    Submits a raw transaction (serialized and signed) for broadcasting to the network. The transaction data should be encoded as a hexadecimal string starting with `0x`. You can create and sign a transaction externally using libraries like [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) or [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/). 

    **Note:** For [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) transactions, the raw form must be in the network format, which includes blobs, KZG commitments, and KZG proofs.
