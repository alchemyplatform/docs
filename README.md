# Chain OpenRPC Specs

This repository contains the OpenRPC specs for the following chains (all chains currently supported by us):

1. Arbitrum
2. Arbitrum Nova
3. Astar
4. Avalanche
5. Base
6. Berachain
7. Blast
8. BNB
9. CrossFi
10. Ethereum
11. Fantom
12. Flow
13. Gnosis
14. Linea
15. Mantle
16. Metis
17. opBNB
18. Optimism
19. Polygon(`*`)
20. Polygon zkEVM(`*`)
21. Scroll
22. Solana(`**`)
23. Soneium
24. Starknet(`**`)
25. Zetachain
26. zkSync(`*`)

> **Note:**
>
> - (`*`) These chains are Ethereum based but have additional methods & schemas that are not found on Ethereum.
> - (`**`) These chains are not Ethereum based and have completely different methods & schemas than Ethereum.

The specs are generated using the [OpenRPC Generator](https://github.com/open-rpc/generator).

Each chain directory contains an `openrpc.json` file which is the complete OpenRPC spec for that chain. The specs can be re-generated by running `npm run build` in the chain directory (given you've installed all the required dependencies).

The content in the `openrpc.json` files of each chain can be copied into the [OpenRPC Playground](https://playground.open-rpc.org/) to test the APIs.
